<p class="drop-cap"><i><span class="upper-case">I</span> found myself in Twilight Land.</i></p>

<p><i>How I ever got there I cannot tell, but there I was in Twilight
Land.</i></p>

<p><i>What is Twilight Land? It is a wonderful, wonderful place where no
sun shines to scorch your back as you jog along the way, where no
rain falls to make the road muddy and hard to travel, where no wind
blows the dust into your eyes or the chill into your marrow. Where
all is sweet and quiet and ready to go to bed.</i></p>

<p><i>Where is Twilight Land? Ah! that I cannot tell you. You will
either have to ask your mother or find it for yourself.</i></p>

<p><i>There I was in Twilight Land. The birds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span> were singing their
good-night song, and the little frogs were piping “peet, peet.” The
sky overhead was full of still brightness, and the moon in the east
hung in the purple gray like a great bubble as yellow as gold. All
the air was full of the smell of growing things. The high-road was
gray, and the trees were dark.</i></p>

<p><i>I drifted along the road as a soap-bubble floats before the wind,
or as a body floats in a dream. I floated along and I floated along
past the trees, past the bushes, past the mill-pond, past the mill
where the old miller stood at the door looking at me.</i></p>

<p><i>I floated on, and there was the Inn, and it was the Sign of Mother
Goose.</i></p>

<p><i>The sign hung on a pole, and on it was painted a picture of Mother
Goose with her gray gander.</i></p>

<p><i>It was to the Inn I wished to come.</i></p>

<p><i>I floated on, and I would have floated past the Inn, and perhaps
have gotten into the Land of Never-Come-Back-Again, only I caught
at the branch of an apple-tree, and so I stopped myself, though the
apple-blossoms came falling down like pink and white snowflakes.</i></p>

<p><i>The earth and the air and the sky were all still, just as it is
at twilight, and I heard them laughing and talking in the tap-room
of the Inn of the Sign of Mother Goose&mdash;the clinking of glasses,
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span> the rattling and clatter of knives and forks and plates and
dishes. That was where I wished to go.</i></p>

<p><i>So in I went. Mother Goose herself opened the door, and there I
was.</i></p>

<p><i>The room was all full of twilight; but there they sat, every
one of them. I did not count them, but there were ever so many:
Aladdin, and Ali Baba, and Fortunatis, and Jack-the-Giant-Killer,
and Doctor Faustus, and Bidpai, and Cinderella, and Patient
Grizzle, and the Soldier who cheated the Devil, and St. George,
and Hans in Luck, who traded and traded his lump of gold until he
had only an empty churn to show for it; and there was Sindbad the
Sailor, and the Tailor who killed seven flies at a blow, and the
Fisherman who fished up the Genie, and the Lad who fiddled for the
Jew in the bramble-bush, and the Blacksmith who made Death sit in
his apple-tree, and Boots, who always marries the Princess, whether
he wants to or not&mdash;a rag-tag lot as ever you saw in your life,
gathered from every place, and brought together in Twilight Land.</i></p>

<p><i>Each one of them was telling a story, and now it was the turn of
the Soldier who cheated the Devil.</i></p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p><i>“I WILL tell you,” said the Soldier who cheated the Devil, “a
story of a friend of mine.”</i></p>

<p><i>“Take a fresh pipe of tobacco,” said St. George.</i></p>

<p><i>“Thank you, I will,” said the Soldier who cheated the Devil.</i></p>

<p><i>He filled his long pipe full of tobacco, and then he tilted it
upside down and sucked in the light of the candle.</i></p>

<p><i>Puff! puff! puff! and a cloud of smoke went up about his head, so
that you could just see his red nose shining through it, and his
bright eyes twinkling in the midst of the smoke-wreath, like two
stars through a thin cloud on a summer night.</i></p>

<p><i>“I’ll tell you,” said the Soldier who cheated the Devil, “the
story of a friend of mine. ’Tis every word of it just as true as
that I myself cheated the Devil.”</i></p>

<p><i>He took a drink from his mug of beer, and then he began.</i></p>

<p><i>“’Tis called,” said he</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 154px;">

</div>

<p>Once upon a time there came a soldier marching along the road,
kicking up a little cloud of dust at each step&mdash;as strapping and
merry and bright-eyed a fellow as you would wish to see in a summer
day. Tramp! tramp! tramp! he marched, whistling as he jogged along,
though he carried a heavy musket over his shoulder and though the
sun shone hot and strong and there was never a tree in sight to
give him a bit of shelter.</p>

<p>At last he came in sight of the King’s Town and to a great field of
stocks and stones, and there sat a little old man as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span> withered and
brown as a dead leaf, and clad all in scarlet from head to foot.</p>

<p>“Ho! soldier,” said he, “are you a good shot?”</p>

<p>“Aye,” said the soldier, “that is my trade.”</p>

<p>“Would you like to earn a dollar by shooting off your musket for
me?”</p>

<p>“Aye,” said the soldier, “that is my trade also.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then,” said the little man in red, “here is a silver
button to drop into your gun instead of a bullet. Wait you here,
and about sunset there will come a great black bird flying. In one
claw it carries a feather cap and in the other a round stone. Shoot
me the silver button at that bird, and if your aim is good it will
drop the feather cap and the pebble. Bring them to me to the great
town-gate and I will pay you a dollar for your trouble.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the soldier, “shooting my gun is a job that fits
me like an old coat.” So, down he sat and the old man went his way.</p>

<p>Well, there he sat and sat and sat and sat until the sun touched
the rim of the ground, and then, just as the old man said, there
came flying a great black bird as silent as night. The soldier did
not tarry to look or to think. As the bird flew by up came the
gun to his shoulder, squint went his eye along the barrel&mdash;Puff!
Bang!&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 344px;">
<img src="images/i_b_007.png" width="344" height="500" alt="demon flying away, smoking" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>I vow and declare that if the shot he fired had cracked the sky he
could not have been more frightened. The great black bird gave a
yell so terrible that it curdled the very blood in his veins and
made his hair stand upon end. Away it flew like a flash&mdash;a bird
no longer, but a great, black demon, smoking and smelling most
horribly of brimstone, and when the soldier gathered his wits,
there lay the feather cap and a little, round, black stone upon the
ground.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the soldier, “it is little wonder that the old man had
no liking to shoot at such game as that.” And thereupon he popped
the feather cap into one pocket and the round stone into another,
and shouldering his musket marched away until he reached the
town-gate, and there was the old man waiting for him.</p>

<p>“Did you shoot the bird?” said he.</p>

<p>“I did,” said the soldier.</p>

<p>“And did you get the cap and the round stone?”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“Then here is your dollar.”</p>

<p>“Wait a bit,” said the soldier,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span> “I shot greater game that time than
I bargained for, and so it’s ten dollars and not one you shall
pay me before you lay finger upon the feather cap and the little
stone.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the old man, “here are ten dollars.”</p>

<p>“Ho! ho!” thought the soldier, “is that the way the wind
blows?”&mdash;“Did I say ten dollars?” said he; “’twas a hundred dollars
I meant.”</p>

<p>At that the old man frowned until his eyes shone green. “Very
well,” said he, “if it is a hundred dollars you want, you will have
to come home with me, for I have not so much with me.” Thereupon he
entered the town with the soldier at his heels.</p>

<p>Up one street he went and down another, until at last he came to
a great, black, ancient, ramshackle house; and that was where he
lived. In he walked without so much as a rap at the door, and so
led the way to a great room with furnaces and books and bottles
and jars and dust and cobwebs, and three grinning skulls upon the
mantelpiece, each with a candle stuck atop of it, and there he left
the soldier while he went to get the hundred dollars.</p>

<p>The soldier sat him down upon a three-legged stool in the corner
and began staring about him; and he liked the looks of the place as
little as any he had seen in all of his life, for it smelled musty
and dusty, it did: the three skulls grinned at him, and he began to
think that the little old man was no better than he should be. “I
wish,” says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span> he, at last, “that instead of being here I might be
well out of my scrape and in a safe place.”</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 210px;">
<img src="images/i_b_010.png" width="210" height="400" alt="soldier flying on a stool" />
</div>

<p>Now the little old man in scarlet was a great magician, and there
was little or nothing in that house that had not some magic about
it, and of all things the three-legged stool had been conjured the
most.</p>

<p>“I wish that instead of being here I might be well out of my
scrape, and in a safe place.” That was what the soldier said; and
hardly had the words left his lips when&mdash;whisk! whir!&mdash;away flew
the stool through the window, so suddenly that the soldier had only
just time enough to gripe it tight by the legs to save himself from
falling. Whir! whiz!&mdash;away it flew like a bullet. Up and up it
went&mdash;so high in the air that the earth below looked like a black
blanket spread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span> out in the night; and then down it came again,
with the soldier still griping tight to the legs, until at last it
settled as light as a feather upon a balcony of the king’s palace;
and when the soldier caught his wind again he found himself without
a hat, and with hardly any wits in his head.</p>

<p>There he sat upon the stool for a long time without daring to move,
for he did not know what might happen to him next. There he sat and
sat, and by-and-by his ears got cold in the night air, and then
he noticed for the first time that he had lost his head gear, and
bethought himself of the feather cap in his pocket. So out he drew
it and clapped it upon his head, and then&mdash;lo and behold!&mdash;he found
he had become as invisible as thin air&mdash;not a shred or a hair of
him could be seen. “Well!” said he, “here is another wonder, but I
am safe now at any rate.” And up he got to find some place not so
cool as where he sat.</p>

<p>He stepped in at an open window, and there he found himself in
a beautiful room, hung with cloth of silver and blue, and with
chairs and tables of white and gold; dozens and scores of waxlights
shone like so many stars, and lit every crack and cranny as bright
as day, and there at one end of the room upon a couch, with her
eyelids closed and fast asleep, lay the prettiest princess that
ever the sun shone upon. The soldier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span> stood and looked and looked
at her, and looked and looked at her, until his heart melted within
him like soft butter, and then he kissed her.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_b_013.png" width="600" height="336" alt="sleeping princess" />
</div>

<p>“Who is that?” said the princess, starting up, wide-awake, but not
a soul could she see, because the soldier had the feather cap upon
his head.</p>

<p>“Who is that?” said she again; and then the soldier answered, but
without taking the feather cap from his head.</p>

<p>“It is I,” said he, “and I am King of the Wind, and ten times
greater than the greatest of kings here below. One day I saw you
walking in your garden and fell in love with you, and now I have
come to ask you if you will marry me and be my wife?”</p>

<p>“But how can I marry you?” said the princess, “without seeing you?”</p>

<p>“You shall see me,” said the soldier, “all in good time. Three days
from now I will come again, and will show myself to you, but just
now it cannot be. But if I come, will you marry me?”</p>

<p>“Yes I will,” said the princess, “for I like the way you talk&mdash;that
I do!”</p>

<p>Thereupon the soldier kissed her and said good-bye, and then
stepped out of the window as he had stepped in. He sat him down
upon his three-legged stool. “I wish,” said he, “to be carried to
such and such a tavern.” For he had been in that town before, and
knew the places where good living was to be had.</p>

<p>Whir! whiz! Away flew the stool as high and higher than it had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
flown before, and then down it came again, and down and down until
it lit as light as a feather in the street before the tavern
door. The soldier tucked his feather cap in his pocket, and the
three-legged stool under his arm, and in he went and ordered a pot
of beer and some white bread and cheese.</p>

<p>Meantime, at the king’s palace was such a gossiping and such a
hubbub as had not been heard there for many a day; for the pretty
princess was not slow in telling how the invisible King of the Wind
had come and asked her to marry him; and some said it was true and
some said it was not true, and everybody wondered and talked, and
told their own notions of the matter. But all agreed that three
days would show whether what had been told was true or no.</p>

<p>As for the soldier, he knew no more how to do what he had promised
to do than my grandmother’s cat; for where was he to get clothes
fine enough for the King of the Wind to wear? So there he sat on
his three-legged stool thinking and thinking, and if he had known
all that I know he would not have given two turns of his wit upon
it. “I wish,” says he, at last&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>“I wish that this stool could help
me now as well as it can carry me through the sky. I wish,” says
he, “that I had a suit of clothes such as the King of the Wind
might really wear.”</p>

<p>The wonders of the three-legged stool were wonders indeed!</p>

<p>Hardly had the words left the soldier’s lips when down came
something tumbling about his ears from up in the air; and what
should it be but just such a suit of clothes as he had in his
mind&mdash;all crusted over with gold and silver and jewels.</p>

<p>“Well,” says the soldier, as soon as he had got over his wonder
again, “I would rather sit upon this stool than any I ever saw.”
And so would I, if I had been in his place, and had a few minutes
to think of all that I wanted.</p>

<p>So he found out the trick of the stool, and after that wishing
and having were easy enough, and by the time the three days were
ended the real King of the Wind himself could not have cut a finer
figure. Then down sat the soldier upon his stool, and wished
himself at the king’s palace. Away he flew through the air, and
by-and-by there he was, just where he had been before. He put his
feather cap upon his head, and stepped in through the window, and
there he found the princess with her father, the king, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span> her
mother, the queen, and all the great lords and nobles waiting for
his coming; but never a stitch nor a hair did they see of him until
he stood in the very midst of them all. Then he whipped the feather
cap off of his head, and there he was, shining with silver and gold
and glistening with jewels&mdash;such a sight as man’s eyes never saw
before.</p>

<p>“Take her,” said the king, “she is yours.” And the soldier looked
so handsome in his fine clothes that the princess was as glad to
hear those words as any she had ever listened to in all of her life.</p>

<p>“You shall,” said the king, “be married to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the soldier. “Only give me a plot of ground to
build a palace upon that shall be fit for the wife of the King of
the Wind to live in.”</p>

<p>“You shall have it,” said the king, “and it shall be the great
parade ground back of the palace, which is so wide and long that
all my army can march round and round in it without getting into
its own way; and that ought to be big enough.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the soldier, “it is.” Thereupon he put on his feather
cap and disappeared from the sight of all as quickly as one might
snuff out a candle.</p>

<p>He mounted his three-legged stool and away he flew through the air
until he had come again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span> to the tavern where he was lodging. There
he sat him down and began to churn his thoughts, and the butter
he made was worth the having, I can tell you. He wished for a
grand palace of white marble, and then he wished for all sorts of
things to fill it&mdash;the finest that could be had. Then he wished for
servants in clothes of gold and silver, and then he wished for fine
horses and gilded coaches. Then he wished for gardens and orchards
and lawns and flower-plats and fountains, and all kinds and sorts
of things, until the sweat ran down his face from hard thinking and
wishing. And as he thought and wished, all the things he thought
and wished for grew up like soap-bubbles from nothing at all.</p>

<p>Then, when day began to break, he wished himself with his fine
clothes to be in the palace that his own wits had made, and away he
flew through the air until he had come there safe and sound.</p>

<p>But when the sun rose and shone down upon the beautiful palace and
all the gardens and orchards around it, the king and queen and all
the court stood dumb with wonder at the sight. Then, as they stood
staring, the gates opened and out came the soldier riding in his
gilded coach with his servants in silver and gold marching beside
him, and such a sight the daylight never looked upon before that
day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>Well, the princess and the soldier were married, and if no couple
had ever been happy in the world before, they were then. Nothing
was heard but feasting and merrymaking, and at night all the sky
was lit with fireworks. Such a wedding had never been before, and
all the world was glad that it had happened.</p>

<p>That is, all the world but one; that one was the old man dressed
in scarlet that the soldier had met when he first came to town.
While all the rest were in the hubbub of rejoicing, he put on his
thinking-cap, and by-and-by began to see pretty well how things
lay, and that, as they say in our town, there was a fly in the
milk-jug. “Ho, ho!” thought he, “so the soldier has found out all
about the three-legged stool, has he? Well, I will just put a spoke
into his wheel for him.” And so he began to watch for his chance to
do the soldier an ill turn.</p>

<p>Now, a week or two after the wedding, and after all the gay doings
had ended, a grand hunt was declared, and the king and his new
son-in-law and all the court went to it. That was just such a
chance as the old magician had been waiting for; so the night
before the hunting-party returned he climbed the walls of the
garden, and so came to the wonderful palace that the soldier had
built out of nothing at all, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span> there stood three men keeping
guard so that no one might enter.</p>

<p>But little that troubled the magician. He began to mutter spells
and strange words, and all of a sudden he was gone, and in his
place was a great black ant, for he had changed himself into an
ant. In he ran through a crack of the door (and mischief has got
into many a man’s house through a smaller hole for the matter of
that). In and out ran the ant through one room and another, and
up and down and here and there, until at last in a far-away part
of the magic palace he found the three-legged stool, and if I
had been in the soldier’s place I would have chopped it up into
kindling-wood after I had gotten all that I wanted. But there it
was, and in an instant the magician resumed his own shape. Down he
sat him upon the stool. “I wish,” said he, “that this palace and
the princess and all who are within it, together with its orchards
and its lawns and its gardens and everything, may be removed to
such and such a country, upon the other side of the earth.”</p>

<p>And as the stool had obeyed the soldier, so everything was done now
just as the magician said.</p>

<p>The next morning back came the hunting-party, and as they rode over
the hill&mdash;lo and behold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span> hold!&mdash;there lay stretched out the great
parade ground in which the king’s armies used to march around and
around, and the land was as bare as the palm of my hand. Not a
stick or a stone of the palace was left; not a leaf or a blade of
the orchards or gardens was to be seen.</p>

<p>The soldier sat as dumb as a fish, and the king stared with
eyes and mouth wide open. “Where is the palace, and where is my
daughter?” said he, at last, finding words and wit.</p>

<p>“I do not know,” said the soldier.</p>

<p>The king’s face grew as black as thunder. “You do not know?” he
said, “then you must find out. Seize the traitor!” he cried.</p>

<p>But that was easier said than done, for, quick as a wink, as they
came to lay hold of him, the soldier whisked the feather cap from
his pocket and clapped it upon his head, and then they might as
well have hoped to find the south wind in winter as to find him.</p>

<p>But though he got safe away from that trouble he was deep enough in
the dumps, you may be sure of that. Away he went, out into the wide
world, leaving that town behind him. Away he went, until by-and-by
he came to a great forest, and for three days he travelled on and
on&mdash;he knew not whither. On the third night, as he sat beside a
fire which he had built to keep him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span> warm, he suddenly bethought
himself of the little round stone which had dropped from the bird’s
claw, and which he still had in his pocket. “Why should it not
also help me,” said he, “for there must be some wonder about it.”
So he brought it out, and sat looking at it and looking at it, but
he could make nothing of it for the life of him. Nevertheless, it
might have some wishing power about it, like the magic stool. “I
wish,” said the soldier, “that I might get out of this scrape.”
That is what we have all wished many and many a time in a like
case; but just now it did the soldier no more good to wish than it
does good for the rest of us. “Bah!” said he, “it is nothing but a
black stone after all.” And then he threw it into the fire.</p>

<p>Puff! Bang! Away flew the embers upon every side, and back tumbled
the soldier, and there in the middle of the flame stood just such a
grim, black being as he had one time shot at with the silver button.</p>

<p>As for the poor soldier, he just lay flat on his back and stared
with eyes like saucers, for he thought that his end had come for
sure.</p>

<p>“What are my lord’s commands?” said the being, in a voice that
shook the marrow of the soldier’s bones.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” said the soldier.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 422px;">
<img src="images/i_b_023.png" width="422" height="600" alt="grim, black being standing the middle of the flame" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am the spirit of the stone,” said the being. “You have heated it
in the flame, and I am here. Whatever you command I must obey.”</p>

<p>“Say you so?” cried the soldier, scrambling to his feet. “Very
well, then, just carry me to where I may find my wife and my palace
again.”</p>

<p>Without a word the spirit of the stone snatched the soldier up, and
flew away with him swifter than the wind. Over forest, over field,
over mountain and over valley he flew, until at last, just at the
crack of day, he set him down in front of his own palace gate in
the far country where the magician had transported it.</p>

<p>After that the soldier knew his way quickly enough. He clapped his
feather cap upon his head and into the palace he went, and from one
room to another, until at last he came to where the princess sat
weeping and wailing, with her pretty eyes red from long crying.</p>

<p>Then the soldier took off his cap again, and you may guess what
sounds of rejoicing followed. They sat down beside one another, and
after the soldier had eaten, the princess told him all that had
happened to her; how the magician had found the stool, and how he
had transported the palace to this far-away land; how he came every
day and begged her to marry him&mdash;which she would rather die than
do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>To all this the soldier listened, and when she had ended her story
he bade her to dry her tears, for, after all, the jug was only
cracked, and not past mending. Then he told her that when the
sorcerer came again that day she should say so and so and so and
so, and that he would be by to help her with his feather cap upon
his head.</p>

<p>After that they sat talking together as happy as two turtle-doves,
until the magician’s foot was heard on the stairs. And then the
soldier clapped his feather cap upon his head just as the door
opened.</p>

<p>“Snuff, snuff!” said the magician, sniffing the air, “here is a
smell of Christian blood.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the princess, “that is so; there came a peddler to-day,
but after all he did not stay long.”</p>

<p>“He’d better not come again,” said the magician, “or it will be the
worse for him. But tell me, will you marry me?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the princess, “I shall not marry you until you can prove
yourself to be a greater man than my husband.”</p>

<p>“Pooh!” said the magician, “that will be easy enough to prove; tell
me how you would have me do so and I will do it.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the princess,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span> “then let me see you change
yourself into a lion. If you can do that I may perhaps believe you
to be as great as my husband.”</p>

<p>“It shall,” said the magician, “be as you say.” He began to mutter
spells and strange words, and then all of a sudden he was gone, and
in his place there stood a lion with bristling mane and flaming
eyes&mdash;a sight fit of itself to kill a body with terror.</p>

<p>“That will do!” cried the princess, quaking and trembling at the
sight, and thereupon the magician took his own shape again.</p>

<p>“Now,” said he, “do you believe that I am as great as the poor
soldier?”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” said the princess; “I have seen how big you can make
yourself, now I wish to see how little you can become. Let me see
you change yourself into a mouse.”</p>

<p>“So be it,” said the magician, and began again to mutter his
spells. Then all of a sudden he was gone just as he was gone
before, and in his place was a little mouse sitting up and looking
at the princess with a pair of eyes like glass beads.</p>

<p>But he did not sit there long. This was what the soldier had
planned for, and all the while he had been standing by with his
feather hat upon his head. Up he raised his foot, and down he set
it upon the mouse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>Crunch!&mdash;that was an end of the magician.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_b_027.png" width="600" height="206" alt="magician's clothes are left behind" />
</div>

<p>After that all was clear sailing; the soldier hunted up the
three-legged stool and down he sat upon it, and by dint of no more
than just a little wishing, back flew palace and garden and all
through the air again to the place whence it came.</p>

<p>I do not know whether the old king ever believed again that
his son-in-law was the King of the Wind; anyhow, all was peace
and friendliness thereafter, for when a body can sit upon a
three-legged stool and wish to such good purpose as the soldier
wished, a body is just as good as a king, and a good deal better,
to my mind.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Talisman_of_Solomon" id="The_Talisman_of_Solomon"></a>The Talisman <i>of</i> Solomon.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 267px;">
<img src="images/i_b_029.png" width="267" height="500" alt="Aben Hassen the Wise and the King of Demons of the Earth" />
</div>

<p>There was once upon a time a man whom other men called Aben Hassen
the Wise. He had read a thousand books of magic, and knew all that
the ancients or moderns had to tell of the hidden arts.</p>

<p>The King of the Demons of the Earth, a great and hideous monster,
named Zadok, was his servant, and came and went as Aben Hassen the
Wise ordered, and did as he bade. After Aben Hassen learned all
that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span> possible for man to know, he said to himself, “Now I
will take my ease and enjoy my life.” So he called the Demon Zadok
to him, and said to the monster, “I have read in my books that
there is a treasure that was one time hidden by the ancient kings
of Egypt&mdash;a treasure such as the eyes of man never saw before or
since their day. Is that true?”</p>

<p>“It is true,” said the Demon.</p>

<p>“Then I command thee to take me to that treasure and to show it to
me,” said Aben Hassen the Wise.</p>

<p>“It shall be done,” said the Demon; and thereupon he caught up the
Wise Man and transported him across mountain and valley, across
land and sea, until he brought him to a country known as the “Land
of the Black Isles,” where the treasure of the ancient kings was
hidden. The Demon showed the Magician the treasure, and it was a
sight such as man had never looked upon before or since the days
that the dark, ancient ones hid it. With his treasure Aben Hassen
built himself palaces and gardens and paradises such as the world
never saw before. He lived like an emperor, and the fame of his
doings rang through all the four corners of the earth.</p>

<p>Now the queen of the Black Isles was the most beautiful woman in
the world, but she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span> as cruel and wicked and cunning as she was
beautiful. No man that looked upon her could help loving her; for
not only was she as beautiful as a dream, but her beauty was of
that sort that it bewitched a man in spite of himself.</p>

<p>One day the queen sent for Aben Hassen the Wise. “Tell me,” said
she, “is it true that men say of you that you have discovered a
hidden treasure such as the world never saw before?” And she looked
at Aben Hassen so that his wisdom all crumbled away like sand, and
he became just as foolish as other men.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said he, “it is true.”</p>

<p>Aben Hassen the Wise spent all that day with the queen, and when
he left the palace he was like a man drunk and dizzy with love.
Moreover, he had promised to show the queen the hidden treasure the
next day.</p>

<p>As Aben Hassen, like a man in a dream, walked towards his own
house, he met an old man standing at the corner of the street. The
old man had a talisman that hung dangling from a chain, and which
he offered for sale. When Aben Hassen saw the talisman he knew very
well what it was&mdash;that it was the famous talisman of King Solomon
the Wise. If he who possessed the talisman asked it to speak, it
would tell that man both what to do and what not to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>The Wise Man bought the talisman for three pieces of silver (and
wisdom has been sold for less than that many a time), and as soon
as he had the talisman in his hands he hurried home with it and
locked himself in a room.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” said the Wise Man to the Talisman, “shall I marry the
beautiful queen of the Black Isles?”</p>

<p>“Fly, while there is yet time to escape!” said the Talisman; “but
go not near the queen again, for she seeks to destroy thy life.”</p>

<p>“But tell me, O Talisman!” said the Wise Man, “what then shall I do
with all that vast treasure of the kings of Egypt?”</p>

<p>“Fly from it while there is yet chance to escape!” said the
Talisman; “but go not into the treasure-house again, for in the
farther door, where thou hast not yet looked, is that which will
destroy him who possesses the treasure.”</p>

<p>“But Zadok,” said Aben Hassen; “what of Zadok?”</p>

<p>“Fly from the monster while there is yet time to escape,” said the
Talisman, “and have no more to do with thy Demon slave, for already
he is weaving a net of death and destruction about thy feet.”</p>

<p>The Wise Man sat all that night pondering and thinking upon what
the Talisman had said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span> When morning came he washed and dressed
himself, and called the Demon Zadok to him. “Zadok,” said he,
“carry me to the palace of the queen.” In the twinkling of an eye
the Demon transported him to the steps of the palace.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 314px;">
<img src="images/i_b_033.png" width="314" height="500" alt="Aben Hassen speaking with the Talisman" />
</div>

<p>“Zadok,” said the Wise Man, “give me the staff of life and death;”
and the Demon brought from under his clothes a wand, one-half of
which was of silver and one-half of which was of gold. The Wise Man
touched the steps of the palace with the silver end of the staff.
Instantly all the sound and hum of life was hushed. The thread of
life was cut by the knife of silence, and in a moment all was as
still as death.</p>

<p>“Zadok,” said the Wise Man, “transport me to the treasure-house of
the king of Egypt.” And instantly the Demon had transported him
thither. The Wise Man drew a circle upon the earth. “No one,” said
he, “shall have power to enter here but the master of Zadok, the
King of the Demons of the Earth.”</p>

<p>“And now, Zadok,” said he, “I command thee to transport me to
India, and as far from here as thou canst.” Instantly the Demon
did as he was commanded; and of all the treasure that he had, the
Wise Man took nothing with him but a jar of golden money and a jar
of silver money. As soon as the Wise Man stood upon the ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span> of
India, he drew from beneath his robe a little jar of glass.</p>

<p>“Zadok,” said he, “I command thee to enter this jar.”</p>

<p>Then the Demon knew that now his turn had come. He besought and
implored the Wise Man to have mercy upon him; but it was all in
vain. Then the Demon roared and bellowed till the earth shook and
the sky grew dark overhead. But all was of no avail; into the jar
he must go, and into the jar he went. Then the Wise Man stoppered
the jar and sealed it. He wrote an inscription of warning upon it,
and then he buried it in the ground.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Aben Hassen the Wise to the Talisman of Solomon, “have
I done everything that I should?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the Talisman, “thou shouldst not have brought the jar
of golden money and the jar of silver money with thee; for that
which is evil in the greatest is evil in the least. Thou fool! The
treasure is cursed! cast it all from thee while there is yet time.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will do that, too,” said the Wise Man. So he buried in the
earth the jar of gold and the jar of silver that he had brought
with him, and then he stamped the mould down upon it. After that
the Wise Man began his life all over again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span> He bought, and he
sold, and he traded, and by-and-by he became rich. Then he built
himself a great house, and in the foundation he laid the jar in
which the Demon was bottled.</p>

<p>Then he married a young and handsome wife. By-and-by the wife bore
him a son, and then she died.</p>

<p>This son was the pride of his father’s heart; but he was as vain
and foolish as his father was wise, so that all men called him Aben
Hassen the Fool, as they called the father Aben Hassen the Wise.</p>

<p>Then one day death came and called the old man, and he left his son
all that belonged to him&mdash;even the Talisman of Solomon.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Young Aben Hassen the Fool had never seen so much money as now
belonged to him. It seemed to him that there was nothing in the
world he could not enjoy. He found friends by the dozens and
scores, and everybody seemed to be very fond of him.</p>

<p>He asked no questions of the Talisman of Solomon, for to his mind
there was no need of being both wise and rich. So he began enjoying
himself with his new friends. Day and night there was feasting and
drinking and singing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span> and dancing and merrymaking and carousing;
and the money that the old man had made by trading and wise living
poured out like water through a sieve.</p>

<p>Then, one day came an end to all this junketing, and nothing
remained to the young spendthrift of all the wealth that his father
had left him. Then the officers of the law came down upon him and
seized all that was left of the fine things, and his fair-weather
friends flew away from his troubles like flies from vinegar. Then
the young man began to think of the Talisman of Wisdom. For it was
with him as it is with so many of us: When folly has emptied the
platter, wisdom is called in to pick the bones.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” said the young man to the Talisman of Solomon, “what
shall I do, now that everything is gone?”</p>

<p>“Go,” said the Talisman of Solomon, “and work as thy father has
worked before thee. Advise with me and become prosperous and
contented, but do not go dig under the cherry-tree in the garden.”</p>

<p>“Why should I not dig under the cherry-tree in the garden?” says
the young man; “I will see what is there, at any rate.”</p>

<p>So he straightway took a spade and went out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span> into the garden, where
the Talisman had told him not to go. He dug and dug under the
cherry-tree, and by-and-by his spade struck something hard. It was
a vessel of brass, and it was full of silver money. Upon the lid of
the vessel were these words, engraved in the handwriting of the old
man who had died:</p>

<p>“My son, this vessel full of silver has been brought from the
treasure-house of the ancient kings of Egypt. Take this, then, that
thou findest; advise with the Talisman; be wise and prosper.”</p>

<p>“And they call that the Talisman of Wisdom,” said the young man.
“If I had listened to it I never would have found this treasure.”</p>

<p>The next day he began to spend the money he had found, and his
friends soon gathered around him again.</p>

<p>The vessel of silver money lasted a week, and then it was all gone;
not a single piece was left.</p>

<p>Then the young man bethought himself again of the Talisman of
Solomon. “What shall I do now,” said he, “to save myself from ruin?”</p>

<p>“Earn thy bread with honest labor,” said the Talisman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span> “and I will
teach thee how to prosper; but do not dig beneath the fig-tree that
stands by the fountain in the garden.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 310px;">
<img src="images/i_b_039.png" width="310" height="400" alt="the young man unearths a copper vessel" />
</div>

<p>The young man did not tarry long after he heard what the Talisman
had said. He seized a spade and hurried away to the fig-tree in the
garden as fast as he could run. He dug and dug, and by-and-by his
spade struck something hard. It was a copper vessel, and it was
filled with gold money. Upon the lid of the vessel was engraved
these words in the handwriting of the old man who had gone: “My
son, my son,” they said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span> “thou hast been warned once; be warned
again. The gold money in this vessel has been brought from the
treasure-house of the ancient kings of Egypt. Take it; be advised
by the Talisman of Solomon; be wise and prosper.”</p>

<p>“And to think that if I had listened to the Talisman, I would never
have found this,” said the young man.</p>

<p>The gold in the vessel lasted maybe for a month of jollity and
merrymaking, but at the end of that time there was nothing
left&mdash;not a copper farthing.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” said the young man to the Talisman, “what shall I do
now?”</p>

<p>“Thou fool,” said the Talisman, “go sweat and toil, but do not go
down into the vault beneath this house. There in the vault is a red
stone built into the wall. The red stone turns upon a pivot. Behind
the stone is a hollow space. As thou wouldst save thy life from
peril, go not near it!”</p>

<p>“Hear that now,” says the young man, “first, this Talisman told
me not to go, and I found silver. Then it told me not to go, and
I found gold; now it tells me not to go&mdash;perhaps I shall find
precious stones enough for a king’s ransom.”</p>

<p>He lit a lantern and went down into the vault beneath the house.
There, as the Talisman had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span> said, was the red stone built into the
wall. He pressed the stone, and it turned upon its pivot as the
Talisman had said it would turn. Within was a hollow space, as
the Talisman said there would be. In the hollow space there was
a casket of silver. The young man snatched it up, and his hands
trembled for joy.</p>

<p>Upon the lid of the box were these words in the father’s
handwriting, written in letters as red as blood: “Fool, fool! Thou
hast been a fool once, thou hast been a fool twice; be not a fool
for a third time. Restore this casket whence it was taken, and
depart.”</p>

<p>“I will see what is in the box, at any rate,” said the young man.</p>

<p>He opened it. There was nothing in it but a hollow glass jar the
size of an egg. The young man took the jar from the box; it was as
hot as fire. He cried out and let it fall. The jar burst upon the
floor with a crack of thunder; the house shook and rocked, and the
dust flew about in clouds. Then all was still; and when Aben Hassen
the Fool could see through the cloud of terror that enveloped him
he beheld a great, tall, hideous being as black as ink, and with
eyes that shone like coals of fire.</p>

<p>When the young man saw that terrible creature his tongue clave to
the roof of his mouth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span> and his knees smote together with fear, for
he thought that his end had now certainly come.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” he croaked, as soon as he could find his voice.</p>

<p>“I am the King of the Demons of the Earth, and my name is Zadok,”
answered the being. “I was once thy father’s slave, and now I am
thine, thou being his son. When thou speakest I must obey, and
whatever thou commandest me to do that I must do.”</p>

<p>“For instance, what can you do for me?” said the young man.</p>

<p>“I can do whatsoever you ask me; I can make you rich.”</p>

<p>“You can make me rich?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I can make you richer than a king.”</p>

<p>“Then make me rich as soon as you can,” said Aben Hassen the Fool,
“and that is all that I shall ask of you now.”</p>

<p>“It shall be done,” said the Demon; “spend all that thou canst
spend, and thou shalt always have more. Has my lord any further
commands for his slave?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the young man, “there is nothing more; you may go now.”</p>

<p>And thereupon the Demon vanished like a flash.</p>

<p>“And to think,” said the young man, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span> came up out of the
vault&mdash;“and to think that all this I should never have found if I
had obeyed the Talisman.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 284px;">
<img src="images/i_b_043.png" width="284" height="500" alt="the young man asks the demon for riches" />
</div>

<p>Such riches were never seen in that land as the young man now
possessed. There was no end to the treasure that poured in upon
him. He lived like an emperor. He built a palace more splendid
than the palace of the king. He laid out vast gardens of the most
exquisite beauty, in which there were fountains as white as snow,
trees of rare fruit and flowers that filled all the air with their
perfume, summer-houses of alabaster and ebony.</p>

<p>Every one who visited him was received like a prince, entertained
like a king, given a present fit for an emperor, and sent away
happy. The fame of all these things went out through all the land,
and every one talked of him and the magnificence that surrounded
him.</p>

<p>It came at last to the ears of the king himself, and one day he
said to his minister, “Let us go and see with our own eyes if all
the things reported of this merchant’s son are true.”</p>

<p>So the king and his minister disguised themselves as foreign
merchants, and went that evening to the palace where the young man
lived. A servant dressed in clothes of gold and silver cloth stood
at the door, and called to them to come in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span> and be made welcome.
He led them in, and to a chamber lit with perfumed lamps of gold.
Then six black slaves took them in charge and led them to a bath
of white marble. They were bathed in perfumed water and dried
with towels of fine linen. When they came forth they were clad in
clothes of cloth of silver, stiff with gold and jewels. Then twelve
handsome white slaves led them through a vast and splendid hall to
a banqueting-room.</p>

<p>When they entered they were deafened with the noise of carousing
and merrymaking.</p>

<p>Aben Hassen the Fool sat at the head of the table upon a throne of
gold, with a canopy of gold above his head. When he saw the king
and the minister enter, he beckoned to them to come and sit beside
him. He showed them special favor because they were strangers, and
special servants waited upon them.</p>

<p>The king and his minister had never seen anything like what they
then saw. They could hardly believe it was not all magic and
enchantment. At the end of the feast each of the guests was given
a present of great value, and was sent away rejoicing. The king
received a pearl as big as a marble; the minister a cup of wrought
gold.</p>

<p>The next morning the king and the prime-minister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span> were talking
over what they had seen. “Sire,” said the prime-minister, “I have
no doubt but that the young man has discovered some vast hidden
treasure. Now, according to the laws of this kingdom, the half
of any treasure that is discovered shall belong to the king’s
treasury. If I were in your place I would send for this young man
and compel him to tell me whence comes all this vast wealth.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” said the king; “I had not thought of that before.
The young man shall tell me all about it.”</p>

<p>So they sent a royal guard and brought the young man to the king’s
palace. When the young man saw in the king and the prime-minister
his guests of the night before, whom he had thought to be only
foreign merchants, he fell on his face and kissed the ground before
the throne. But the king spoke to him kindly, and raised him up and
sat him on the seat beside him. They talked for a while concerning
different things, and then the king said at last, “Tell me, my
friend, whence comes all the inestimable wealth that you must
possess to allow you to live as you do?”</p>

<p>“Sire,” said the young man, “I cannot tell you whence it comes. I
can only tell you that it is given to me.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 484px;">
<img src="images/i_b_047.png" width="484" height="500" alt="the young man kisses the ground before the king's throne" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>The king frowned. “You cannot tell,” said he; “you must tell. It is
for that that I have sent for you, and you must tell me.”</p>

<p>Then the young man began to be frightened. “I beseech you,” said
he, “do not ask me whence it comes. I cannot tell you.”</p>

<p>Then the king’s brows grew as black as thunder. “What!” cried
he, “do you dare to bandy words with me? I know that you have
discovered some treasure. Tell me upon the instant where it is; for
the half of it, by the laws of the land, belongs to me, and I will
have it.”</p>

<p>At the king’s words Aben Hassen the Fool fell on his knees. “Sire,”
said he, “I will tell you all the truth. There is a demon named
Zadok&mdash;a monster as black as a coal. He is my slave, and it is he
that brings me all the treasure that I enjoy.” The king thought
nothing else than that Aben Hassen the Fool was trying to deceive
him. He laughed; he was very angry. “What,” cried he, “do you amuse
me by such an absurd and unbelievable tale? Now I am more than
ever sure that you have discovered a treasure and that you wish
to keep the knowledge of it from me, knowing, as you do, that the
one-half of it by law belongs to me. Take him away!” cried he to
his attendants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span> “Give him fifty lashes, and throw him into prison.
He shall stay there and have fifty lashes every day until he tells
me where his wealth is hidden.”</p>

<p>It was done as the king said, and by-and-by Aben Hassen the Fool
lay in the prison, smarting and sore with the whipping he had had.</p>

<p>Then he began again to think of the Talisman of Solomon.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” said he to the Talisman, “what shall I do now to help
myself in this trouble?”</p>

<p>“Bear thy punishment, thou fool,” said the Talisman. “Know that
the king will by-and-by pardon thee and will let thee go. In the
meantime bear thy punishment; perhaps it will cure thee of thy
folly. Only do not call upon Zadok, the King of the Demons, in this
thy trouble.”</p>

<p>The young man smote his hand upon his head. “What a fool I am,”
said he, “not to have thought to call upon Zadok before this!” Then
he called aloud, “Zadok, Zadok! If thou art indeed my slave, come
hither at my bidding.”</p>

<p>In an instant there sounded a rumble as of thunder. The floor
swayed and rocked beneath the young man’s feet. The dust flew in
clouds, and there stood Zadok as black as ink, and with eyes that
shone like coals of fire.</p>

<p>“I have come,” said Zadok, “and first let me cure thy smarts, O
master.”</p>

<p>He removed the cloths from the young ma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>n’s back, and rubbed the
places that smarted with a cooling unguent. Instantly the pain and
smarting ceased, and the merchant’s son had perfect ease.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Zadok, “what is thy bidding?”</p>

<p>“Tell me,” said Aben Hassen the Fool, “whence comes all the wealth
that you have brought me? The king has commanded me to tell him and
I could not, and so he has had me beaten with fifty lashes.”</p>

<p>“I bring the treasure,” said Zadok, “from the treasure-house of the
ancient kings of Egypt. That treasure I at one time discovered to
your father, and he, not desiring it himself, hid it in the earth
so that no one might find it.”</p>

<p>“And where is this treasure-house, O Zadok?” said the young man.</p>

<p>“It is in the city of the queen of the Black Isles,” said the
King of the Demons; “there thy father lived in a palace of such
magnificence as thou hast never dreamed of. It was I that brought
him thence to this place with one vessel of gold money and one
vessel of silver money.”</p>

<p>“It was you who brought him here, did you say, Zadok? Then, tell
me, can you take me from here to the city of the queen of the Black
Isles, whence you brought him?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Zadok, “with ease.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said the young man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span> “I command you to take me thither
instantly, and to show me the treasure.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 417px;">
<img src="images/i_b_051.png" width="417" height="300" alt="The demon flies, carrying the young man by the girdle." />
</div>

<p>“I obey,” said Zadok.</p>

<p>He stamped his foot upon the ground. In an instant the walls of
the prison split asunder, and the sky was above them. The Demon
leaped from the earth, carrying the young man by the girdle, and
flew through the air so swiftly that the stars appeared to slide
away behind them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span> In a moment he set the young man again upon the
ground, and Aben Hassen the Fool found himself at the end of what
appeared to be a vast and splendid garden.</p>

<p>“We are now,” said Zadok, “above the treasure-house of which I
spoke. It was here that I saw thy father seal it so that no one but
the master of Zadok may enter. Thou mayst go in any time it may
please thee, for it is thine.”</p>

<p>“I would enter into it now,” said Aben Hassen the Fool.</p>

<p>“Thou shalt enter,” said Zadok. He stooped, and with his
finger-point he drew a circle upon the ground where they stood;
then he stamped with his heel upon the circle. Instantly the
earth opened, and there appeared a flight of marble steps leading
downward into the earth. Zadok led the way down the steps and
the young man followed. At the bottom of the steps was a door of
adamant. Upon the door were these words in letters as black as ink,
in the handwriting of the old man who had gone:</p>

<p>“Oh, fool! fool! Beware what thou doest. Within here shalt thou
find death!”</p>

<p>There was a key of brass in the door. The King of the Demons turned
the key and opened the door. The young man entered after him.</p>

<p>Aben Hassen the Fool found himself in a vast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span> vaulted room, lit
by the light of a single carbuncle set in the centre of the dome
above. In the middle of the marble floor was a great basin twenty
paces broad, and filled to the brim with money such as he had found
in the brazen vessel in the garden.</p>

<p>The young man could not believe what he saw with his own eyes. “Oh,
marvel of marvels!” he cried; “little wonder you could give me
boundless wealth from such a storehouse as this.”</p>

<p>Zadok laughed. “This,” said he, “is nothing; come with me.”</p>

<p>He led him from this room to another&mdash;like it vaulted, and like it
lit by a carbuncle set in the dome of the roof above. In the middle
of the floor was a basin such as Aben Hassen the Fool had seen in
the other room beyond; only this was filled with gold as that had
been filled with silver, and the gold was like that he had found
in the garden. When the young man saw this vast and amazing wealth
he stood speechless and breathless with wonder. The Demon Zadok
laughed. “This,” said he, “is great, but it is little. Come and I
will show thee a marvel indeed.”</p>

<p>He took the young man by the hand and led him into a third
room&mdash;vaulted as the other two had been, lit as they had been by
a carbuncle in the roof above. But when the young man’s eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span> saw
what was in this third room, he was like a man turned drunk with
wonder. He had to lean against the wall behind him, for the sight
made him dizzy.</p>

<p>In the middle of the room was such a basin as he had seen in the
two other rooms, only it was filled with jewels&mdash;diamonds and
rubies and emeralds and sapphires and precious stones of all
kinds&mdash;that sparkled and blazed and flamed like a million stars.
Around the wall, and facing the basin from all sides, stood six
golden statues. Three of them were statues of the kings and three
of them were statues of the queens who had gathered together all
this vast and measureless wealth of ancient Egypt.</p>

<p>There was space for a seventh statue, but where it should have
stood was a great arched door of adamant. The door was tight shut,
and there was neither lock nor key to it. Upon the door were
written these words in letters of flame:</p>

<p>“Behold! beyond this door is that alone which shall satisfy all thy
desires.”</p>

<p>“Tell me, Zadok,” said the young man, after he had filled his soul
with all the other wonders that surrounded him&mdash;“tell me what is
there that lies beyond that door?”</p>

<p>“That I am forbidden to tell thee, O master!” said the King of the
Demons of the Earth.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 417px;">
<img src="images/i_b_055.png" width="344" height="500" alt="the door that hides what satisfies all desires" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then open the door for me,” said the young man; “for I cannot open
it for myself, as there is neither lock nor key to it.”</p>

<p>“That also I am forbidden to do,” said Zadok.</p>

<p>“I wish that I knew what was there,” said the young man.</p>

<p>The Demon laughed. “Some time,” said he, “thou mayest find for
thyself. Come, let us leave here and go to the palace which thy
father built years ago, and which he left behind him when he
quitted this place for the place in which thou knewest him.”</p>

<p>He led the way and the young man followed; they passed through the
vaulted rooms and out through the door of adamant, and Zadok locked
it behind them and gave the key to the young man.</p>

<p>“All this is thine now,” he said; “I give it to thee as I gave it
to thy father. I have shown thee how to enter, and thou mayst go in
whenever it pleases thee to do so.”</p>

<p>They ascended the steps, and so reached the garden above. Then
Zadok struck his heel upon the ground, and the earth closed as
it had opened. He led the young man from the spot until they had
come to a wide avenue that led to the palace beyond. “Here I leave
thee,” said the Demon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span> “but if ever thou hast need of me, call and
I will come.”</p>

<p>Thereupon he vanished like a flash, leaving the young man standing
like one in a dream.</p>

<p>He saw before him a garden of such splendor and magnificence as he
had never dreamed of even in his wildest fancy. There were seven
fountains as clear as crystal that shot high into the air and fell
back into basins of alabaster. There was a broad avenue as white as
snow, and thousands of lights lit up everything as light as day.
Upon either side of the avenue stood a row of black slaves, clad in
garments of white silk, and with jewelled turbans upon their heads.
Each held a flaming torch of sandal-wood. Behind the slaves stood
a double row of armed men, and behind them a great crowd of other
slaves and attendants, dressed each as magnificently as a prince,
blazing and flaming with innumerable jewels and ornaments of gold.</p>

<p>But of all these things the young man thought nothing and saw
nothing; for at the end of the marble avenue there arose a palace,
the like of which was not in the four quarters of the earth&mdash;a
palace of marble and gold and carmine and ultramarine&mdash;rising into
the purple starry sky, and shining in the moonlight like a vision
of Paradise. The palace was illuminated from top<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span> to bottom and
from end to end; the windows shone like crystal, and from it came
sounds of music and rejoicing.</p>

<p>When the crowd that stood waiting saw the young man appear, they
shouted: “Welcome! welcome! to the master who has come again! To
Aben Hassen the Fool!”</p>

<p>The young man walked up the avenue of marble to the palace,
surrounded by the armed attendants in their dresses of jewels and
gold, and preceded by dancing-girls as beautiful as houris, who
danced and sung before him. He was dizzy with joy. “All&mdash;all this,”
he exulted, “belongs to me. And to think that if I had listened to
the Talisman of Solomon I would have had none of it.”</p>

<p>That was the way he came back to the treasure of the ancient kings
of Egypt, and to the palace of enchantment that his father had
quitted.</p>

<p>For seven months he lived a life of joy and delight, surrounded
by crowds of courtiers as though he were a king, and going from
pleasure to pleasure without end. Nor had he any fear of an end
coming to it, for he knew that his treasure was inexhaustible. He
made friends with the princes and nobles of the land. From far and
wide people came to visit him, and the renown of his magnificence
filled all the world. When men would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span> praise any one they would
say, “He is as rich,” or as “magnificent,” or as “generous, as Aben
Hassen the Fool.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 325px;">
<img src="images/i_b_059.png" width="325" height="500" alt="the young man walked up the avenue of marble to the palace" />
</div>

<p>So for seven months he lived a life of joy and delight; then
one morning he awakened and found everything changed to grief
and mourning. Where the day before had been laughter, to-day
was crying. Where the day before had been mirth, to-day was
lamentation. All the city was shrouded in gloom, and everywhere was
weeping and crying.</p>

<p>Seven black slaves stood on guard near Aben Hassen the Fool as he
lay upon his couch. “What means all this sorrow?” said he to one of
the slaves.</p>

<p>Instantly all the slaves began howling and beating their heads, and
he to whom the young man had spoken fell down with his face in the
dust, and lay there twisting and writhing like a worm.</p>

<p>“He has asked the question!” howled the slaves&mdash;“he has asked the
question!”</p>

<p>“Are you mad?” cried the young man. “What is the matter with you?”</p>

<p>At the doorway of the room stood a beautiful female slave, bearing
in her hands a jewelled basin of gold, filled with rose-water, and
a fine linen napkin for the young man to wash and dry his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span> hands
upon. “Tell me,” said the young man, “what means all this sorrow
and lamentation?”</p>

<p>Instantly the beautiful slave dropped the golden basin upon the
stone floor, and began shrieking and tearing her clothes. “He has
asked the question!” she screamed&mdash;“he has asked the question!”</p>

<p>The young man began to grow frightened; he arose from his couch,
and with uneven steps went out into the anteroom. There he found
his chamberlain waiting for him with a crowd of attendants and
courtiers. “Tell me,” said Aben Hassen the Fool, “why are you all
so sorrowful?”</p>

<p>Instantly they who stood waiting began crying and tearing their
clothes and beating their hands. As for the chamberlain&mdash;he was a
reverend old man&mdash;his eyes sparkled with anger, and his fingers
twitched as though he would have struck if he had dared. “What,” he
cried, “art thou not contented with all thou hast and with all that
we do for thee without asking the forbidden question?”</p>

<p>Thereupon he tore his cap from his head and flung it upon the
ground, and began beating himself violently upon the head with
great outcrying.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 556px;">
<img src="images/i_b_063.png" width="556" height="500" alt="they who stood waiting began crying and tearing their clothes" />
</div>

<p>Aben Hassen the Fool, not knowing what to think or what was to
happen, ran back into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span> bedroom again. “I think everybody in
this place has gone mad,” said he. “Nevertheless, if I do not find
out what it all means, I shall go mad myself.”</p>

<p>Then he bethought himself, for the first time since he came to that
land, of the Talisman of Solomon.</p>

<p>“Tell me, O Talisman,” said he, “why all these people weep and wail
so continuously?”</p>

<p>“Rest content,” said the Talisman of Solomon, “with knowing that
which concerns thine own self, and seek not to find an answer that
will be to thine own undoing. Be thou also further advised: do not
question the Demon Zadok.”</p>

<p>“Fool that I am,” said the young man, stamping his foot; “here am I
wasting all this time when, if I had but thought of Zadok at first,
he would have told me all.” Then he called aloud, “Zadok! Zadok!
Zadok!”</p>

<p>Instantly the ground shook beneath his feet, the dust rose in
clouds, and there stood Zadok as black as ink, and with eyes that
shone like fire.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” said the young man; “I command thee to tell me, O Zadok!
why are the people all gone mad this morning, and why do they weep
and wail, and why do they go crazy when I do but ask them why they
are so afflicted?”</p>

<p>“I will tell thee,” said Zadok.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span> “Seven-and-thirty years ago
there was a queen over this land&mdash;the most beautiful that ever was
seen. Thy father, who was the wisest and most cunning magician in
the world, turned her into stone, and with her all the attendants
in her palace. No one since that time has been permitted to enter
the palace&mdash;it is forbidden for any one even to ask a question
concerning it; but every year, on the day on which the queen was
turned to stone, the whole land mourns with weeping and wailing.
And now thou knowest all!”</p>

<p>“What you tell me,” said the young man, “passes wonder. But tell me
further, O Zadok, is it possible for me to see this queen whom my
father turned to stone?”</p>

<p>“Nothing is easier,” said Zadok.</p>

<p>“Then,” said the young man, “I command you to take me to where she
is, so that I may see her with mine own eyes.”</p>

<p>“I hear and obey,” said the Demon.</p>

<p>He seized the young man by the girdle, and in an instant flew away
with him to a hanging-garden that lay before the queen’s palace.</p>

<p>“Thou art the first man,” said Zadok, “who has seen what thou art
about to see for seven-and-thirty years. Come, I will show thee a
queen, the most beautiful that the eyes of man ever looked upon.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>He led the way, and the young man followed, filled with wonder and
astonishment. Not a sound was to be heard, not a thing moved, but
silence hung like a veil between the earth and the sky.</p>

<p>Following the Demon, the young man ascended a flight of steps, and
so entered the vestibule of the palace. There stood guards in armor
of brass and silver and gold. But they were without life&mdash;they were
all of stone as white as alabaster. Thence they passed through room
after room and apartment after apartment crowded with courtiers
and nobles and lords in their robes of office, magnificent beyond
fancying, but each silent and motionless&mdash;each a stone as white as
alabaster. At last they entered an apartment in the very centre of
the palace. There sat seven-and-forty female attendants around a
couch of purple and gold. Each of the seven-and-forty was beautiful
beyond what the young man could have believed possible, and each
was clad in a garment of silk as white as snow, embroidered with
threads of silver and studded with glistening diamonds. But each
sat silent and motionless&mdash;each was a stone as white as alabaster.</p>

<p>Upon the couch in the centre of the apartment reclined a queen with
a crown of gold upon her head. She lay there motionless, still.
She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span> cold and dead&mdash;of stone as white as marble. The young man
approached and looked into her face, and when he looked his breath
became faint and his heart grew soft within him like wax in a flame
of fire.</p>

<p>He sighed; he melted; the tears burst from his eyes and ran down
his cheeks. “Zadok!” he cried&mdash;“Zadok! Zadok! What have you done to
show me this wonder of beauty and love! Alas! that I have seen her;
for the world is nothing to me now. O Zadok! that she were flesh
and blood, instead of cold stone! Tell me, Zadok, I command you to
tell me, was she once really alive as I am alive, and did my father
truly turn her to stone as she lies here?”</p>

<p>“She was really alive as thou art alive, and he did truly transform
her to this stone,” said Zadok.</p>

<p>“And tell me,” said the young man, “can she never become alive
again?”</p>

<p>“She can become alive, and it lies with you to make her alive,”
said the Demon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span> “Listen, O master. Thy father possessed a wand,
half of silver and half of gold. Whatsoever he touched with silver
became converted to stone, such as thou seest all around thee here;
but whatsoever, O master, he touched with the gold, it became
alive, even if it were a dead stone.”</p>

<p>“Tell me, Zadok,” cried the young man; “I command you to tell me,
where is that wand of silver and gold?”</p>

<p>“I have it with me,” said Zadok.</p>

<p>“Then give it to me; I command you to give it to me.”</p>

<p>“I hear and obey,” said Zadok. He drew from his girdle a wand, half
of gold and half of silver, as he spoke, and gave it to the young
man.</p>

<p>“Thou mayst go now, Zadok,” said the young man, trembling with
eagerness.</p>

<p>Zadok laughed and vanished. The young man stood for a while looking
down at the beautiful figure of alabaster. Then he touched the
lips with the golden tip of the wand. In an instant there came
a marvellous change. He saw the stone melt, and begin to grow
flexible and soft. He saw it become warm, and the cheeks and lips
grow red with life. Meantime a murmur had begun to rise all through
the palace. It grew louder and louder&mdash;it became a shout. The
figure of the queen that had been stone opened its eyes.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” it said.</p>

<p>Aben Hassen the Fool fell upon his knees. “I am he who was sent to
bring you to life,” he said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span> “My father turned you to cold stone,
and I&mdash;I have brought you back to warm life again.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 420px;">
<img src="images/i_b_069.png" width="420" height="500" alt="the young man and the alabaster queen" />
</div>

<p>The queen smiled&mdash;her teeth sparkled like pearls. “If you have
brought me to life, then I am yours,” she said, and she kissed him
upon the lips.</p>

<p>He grew suddenly dizzy; the world swam before his eyes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For seven days nothing was heard in the town but rejoicing and joy.
The young man lived in a golden cloud of delight. “And to think,”
said he, “if I had listened to that accursed Talisman of Solomon,
called ‘The Wise,’ all this happiness, this ecstasy that is now
mine, would have been lost to me.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Tell me, beloved,” said the queen, upon the morning of the seventh
day&mdash;“thy father once possessed all the hidden treasure of the
ancient kings of Egypt&mdash;tell me, is it now thine as it was once
his?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the young man, “it is now all mine as it was once all
his.”</p>

<p>“And do you really love me as you say?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the young man, “and ten thousand times more than I say.”</p>

<p>“Then, as you love me, I beg one boon of you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span> It is that you show
me this treasure of which I have heard so much, and which we are to
enjoy together.”</p>

<p>The young man was drunk with happiness. “Thou shalt see it all,”
said he.</p>

<p>Then, for the first time, the Talisman spoke without being
questioned. “Fool!” it cried; “wilt thou not be advised?”</p>

<p>“Be silent,” said the young man. “Six times, vile thing, you would
have betrayed me. Six times you would have deprived me of joys that
should have been mine, and each was greater than that which went
before. Shall I now listen the seventh time? Now,” said he to the
queen, “I will show you our treasure.” He called aloud, “Zadok,
Zadok, Zadok!”</p>

<p>Instantly the ground shook beneath their feet, the dust rose in
clouds, and Zadok appeared, as black as ink, and with eyes that
shone like coals of fire.</p>

<p>“I command you,” said the young man, “to carry the queen and myself
to the garden where my treasure lies hidden.”</p>

<p>Zadok laughed aloud. “I hear thee and obey thee, master,” said he.</p>

<p>He seized the queen and the young man by the girdle, and in an
instant transported them to the garden and to the treasure-house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thou art where thou commandest to be,” said the Demon.</p>

<p>The young man immediately drew a circle upon the ground with his
finger-tip. He struck his heel upon the circle. The ground opened,
disclosing the steps leading downward. The young man descended the
steps with the queen behind him, and behind them both came the
Demon Zadok.</p>

<p>The young man opened the door of adamant and entered the first of
the vaulted rooms.</p>

<p>When the queen saw the huge basin full of silver treasure, her
cheeks and her forehead flushed as red as fire.</p>

<p>They went into the next room, and when the queen saw the basin of
gold her face turned as white as ashes.</p>

<p>They went into the third room, and when the queen saw the basin of
jewels and the six golden statues her face turned as blue as lead,
and her eyes shone green like a snake’s.</p>

<p>“Are you content?” asked the young man.</p>

<p>The queen looked about her. “No!” cried she, hoarsely, pointing
to the closed door that had never been opened, and whereon were
engraved these words:</p>

<p><strong>“Behold! Beyond this door is that alone which shall satisfy all
thy desires.”</strong></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_b_073.png" width="300" height="500" alt="the young man drew a circle upon the ground with his fingertip" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>“No!” cried she. “What is it that lies behind yon door?”</p>

<p>“I do not know,” said the young man.</p>

<p>“Then open the door, and let me see what lies within.”</p>

<p>“I cannot open the door,” said he. “How can I open the door, seeing
that there is no lock nor key to it?”</p>

<p>“If thou dost not open the door,” said the queen, “all is over
between thee and me. So do as I bid thee, or leave me forever.”</p>

<p>They had both forgotten that the Demon Zadok was there. Then the
young man bethought himself of the Talisman of Solomon. “Tell me, O
Talisman,” said he, “how shall I open yonder door?”</p>

<p>“Oh, wretched one!” cried the Talisman, “oh, wretched one! fly
while there is yet time&mdash;fly, for thy doom is near! Do not push the
door open, for it is not locked!”</p>

<p>The young man struck his head with his clinched fist. “What a fool
am I!” he cried. “Will I never learn wisdom? Here have I been
coming to this place seven months, and have never yet thought to
try whether yonder door was locked or not!”</p>

<p>“Open the door!” cried the queen.</p>

<p>They went forward together. The young man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span> pushed the door with his
hand. It opened swiftly and silently, and they entered.</p>

<p>Within was a narrow room as red as blood. A flaming lamp hung from
the ceiling above. The young man stood as though turned to stone,
for there stood a gigantic Black Demon with a napkin wrapped around
his loins and a scimitar in his right hand, the blade of which
gleamed like lightning in the flame of the lamp. Before him lay a
basket filled with sawdust.</p>

<p>When the queen saw what she saw she screamed in a loud voice, “Thou
hast found it! thou hast found it! Thou hast found what alone can
satisfy all thy desires! Strike, O slave!”</p>

<p>The young man heard the Demon Zadok give a yell of laughter. He saw
a whirl and a flash, and then he knew nothing.</p>

<p>The Black had struck&mdash;the blade had fallen, and the head of Aben
Hassen the Fool rolled into the basket of sawdust that stood
waiting for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>“Aye, aye,” said St. George, “and so it should end. For what was
your Aben Hassen the Fool but a heathen Paniem? Thus should the
heads of all the like be chopped off from their shoulders. Is there
not some one here to tell us a fair story about a saint?”</i></p>

<p><i>“For the matter of that,” said the Lad who fiddled when the Jew
was in the bramble-bush&mdash;“for the matter of that I know a very good

<div class="figleft" style="width: 242px;">
<img src="images/i_b_077.png" width="242" height="500" alt="Ill-Luck and the Fiddler" />
</div>

<p>Once upon a time St. Nicholas came down into the world to take a
peep at the old place and see how things looked in the spring-time.
On he stepped along the road to the town where he used to live, for
he had a notion to find out whether things were going on nowadays
as they one time did. By-and-by he came to a cross-road, and who
should he see sitting there but Ill-Luck himself. Ill-Luck’s face
was as gray as ashes, and his hair as white as snow&mdash;for he is
as old as Grandfather Adam&mdash;and two great wings grew out of his
shoulders&mdash;for he flies fast and comes quickly to those whom he
visits, does Ill-Luck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, St. Nicholas had a pocketful of hazel-nuts, which he kept
cracking and eating as he trudged along the road, and just then he
came upon one with a worm-hole in it. When he saw Ill-Luck it came
into his head to do a good turn to poor sorrowful man.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Ill-Luck,” says he.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, St. Nicholas,” says Ill-Luck.</p>

<p>“You look as hale and strong as ever,” says St. Nicholas.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes,” says Ill-Luck, “I find plenty to do in this world of
woe.”</p>

<p>“They tell me,” says St. Nicholas, “that you can go wherever you
choose, even if it be through a key-hole; now, is that so?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” says Ill-Luck, “it is.”</p>

<p>“Well, look now, friend,” says St. Nicholas, “could you go into
this hazel-nut if you chose to?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” says Ill-Luck, “I could indeed.”</p>

<p>“I should like to see you,” says St. Nicholas; “for then I should
be of a mind to believe what people say of you.”</p>

<p>“Well,” says Ill-Luck, “I have not much time to be pottering and
playing upon Jack’s fiddle; but to oblige an old friend”&mdash;thereupon
he made himself small and smaller, and&mdash;phst! he was in the nut
before you could wink.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Then what do you think St. Nicholas did? In his hand he held a
little plug of wood, and no sooner had Ill-Luck entered the nut
than he stuck the plug in the hole, and there was man’s enemy as
tight as a fly in a bottle.</p>

<p>“So!” says St. Nicholas, “that’s a piece of work well done.” Then
he tossed the hazel-nut under the roots of an oak-tree near by, and
went his way.</p>

<p>And that is how this story begins.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Well, the hazel-nut lay and lay and lay, and all the time that it
lay there nobody met with ill-luck; but, one day, who should come
travelling that way but a rogue of a Fiddler, with his fiddle under
his arm. The day was warm, and he was tired; so down he sat under
the shade of the oak-tree to rest his legs. By-and-by he heard a
little shrill voice piping and crying, “Let me out! let me out! let
me out!”</p>

<p>The Fiddler looked up and down, but he could see nobody. “Who are
you?” says he.</p>

<p>“I am Ill-Luck! Let me out! let me out!”</p>

<p>“Let you out?” says the Fiddler. “Not I; if you are bottled up here
it is the better for all of us;” and, so saying, he tucked his
fiddle under his arm and off he marched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>But before he had gone six steps he stopped. He was one of your
peering, prying sort, and liked more than a little to know all
that was to be known about this or that or the other thing that
he chanced to see or hear. “I wonder where Ill-Luck can be, to be
in such a tight place as he seems to be caught in,” says he to
himself; and back he came again. “Where are you, Ill-Luck?” says he.</p>

<p>“Here I am,” says Ill-Luck&mdash;“here in this hazel-nut, under the
roots of the oak-tree.”</p>

<p>Thereupon the Fiddler laid aside his fiddle and bow, and fell to
poking and prying under the roots until he found the nut. Then he
began twisting and turning it in his fingers, looking first on one
side and then on the other, and all the while Ill-Luck kept crying,
“Let me out! let me out!”</p>

<p>It was not long before the Fiddler found the little wooden plug,
and then nothing would do but he must take a peep inside the nut to
see if Ill-Luck was really there. So he picked and pulled at the
wooden plug, until at last out it came; and&mdash;phst! pop! out came
Ill-Luck along with it.</p>

<p>Plague take the Fiddler! say I.</p>

<p>“Listen,” says Ill-Luck.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span> “It has been many a long day that I have
been in that hazel-nut, and you are the man that has let me out;
for once in a way I will do a good turn to a poor human body.”
Therewith, and without giving the Fiddler time to speak a word,
Ill-Luck caught him up by the belt, and&mdash;whiz! away he flew like a
bullet, over hill and over valley, over moor and over mountain, so
fast that not enough wind was left in the Fiddler’s stomach to say
“Bo!”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 416px;">
<img src="images/i_b_081.png" width="416" height="500" alt="Ill-Luck caught the Fiddler by the belt and flew with him" />
</div>

<p>By-and-by he came to a garden, and there he let the Fiddler drop on
the soft grass below. Then away he flew to attend to other matters
of greater need.</p>

<p>When the Fiddler had gathered his wits together, and himself to
his feet, he saw that he lay in a beautiful garden of flowers and
fruit-trees and marble walks and what not, and that at the end of
it stood a great, splendid house, all built of white marble, with a
fountain in front, and peacocks strutting about on the lawn.</p>

<p>Well, the Fiddler smoothed down his hair and brushed his clothes a
bit, and off he went to see what was to be seen at the grand house
at the end of the garden.</p>

<p>He entered the door, and nobody said no to him. Then he passed
through one room after another, and each was finer than the one
he left behind. Many servants stood around; but they only bowed,
and never asked whence he came.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span> At last he came to a room where a
little old man sat at a table. The table was spread with a feast
that smelled so good that it brought tears to the Fiddler’s eyes
and water to his mouth, and all the plates were of pure gold. The
little old man sat alone, but another place was spread, as though
he were expecting some one. As the Fiddler came in the little old
man nodded and smiled. “Welcome!” he cried; “and have you come at
last?”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_b_083.png" width="600" height="312" alt="little old man at a table spread with a feast" />
</div>

<p>“Yes,” said the Fiddler, “I have. It was Ill-Luck that brought me.”</p>

<p>“Nay,” said the little old man, “do not say that. Sit down to the
table and eat; and when I have told you all, you will say it was
not Ill-Luck, but Good-Luck, that brought you.”</p>

<p>The Fiddler had his own mind about that;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span> but, all the same, down
he sat at the table, and fell to with knife and fork at the good
things, as though he had not had a bite to eat for a week of
Sundays.</p>

<p>“I am the richest man in the world,” says the little old man, after
a while.</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear it,” says the Fiddler.</p>

<p>“You may well be,” said the old man, “for I am all alone in the
world, and without wife or child. And this morning I said to
myself that the first body that came to my house I would take for
a son&mdash;or a daughter, as the case might be. You are the first, and
so you shall live with me as long as I live, and after I am gone
everything that I have shall be yours.”</p>

<p>The Fiddler did nothing but stare with open eyes and mouth, as
though he would never shut either again.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Well, the Fiddler lived with the old man for maybe three or four
days as snug and happy a life as ever a mouse passed in a green
cheese. As for the gold and silver and jewels&mdash;why, they were as
plentiful in that house as dust in a mill! Everything the Fiddler
wanted came to his hand. He lived high, and slept soft and warm,
and never knew what it was to want either more or less, or great
or small. In all of those three or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span> four days he did nothing but
enjoy himself with might and main.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_b_085.png" width="600" height="485" alt="three marble basins set into the floor" />
</div>

<p>But by-and-by he began to wonder where all the good things came
from. Then, before long, he fell to pestering the old man with
questions about the matter.</p>

<p>At first the old man put him off with short answers, but the
Fiddler was a master-hand at finding out anything that he wanted to
know. He dinned and drummed and worried until flesh and blood could
stand it no longer. So at last the old man said that he would show
him the treasure-house where all his wealth came from, and at that
the Fiddler was tickled beyond measure.</p>

<p>The old man took a key from behind the door and led him out into
the garden. There in a corner by the wall was a great trap-door
of iron. The old man fitted the key to the lock and turned it. He
lifted the door, and then went down a steep flight of stone steps,
and the Fiddler followed close at his heels. Down below it was as
light as day, for in the centre of the room hung a great lamp that
shone with a bright light and lit up all the place as bright as
day. In the floor were set three great basins of marble: one was
nearly full of silver, one of gold, and one of gems of all sorts.</p>

<p>“All this is mine,” said the old man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span> “and after I am gone it
shall be yours. It was left to me as I will leave it to you, and
in the meantime you may come and go as you choose and fill your
pockets whenever you wish to. But there is one thing you must not
do: you must never open that door yonder at the back of the room.
Should you do so, Ill-Luck will be sure to overtake you.”</p>

<p>Oh no! The Fiddler would never think of doing such a thing as
opening the door. The silver and gold and jewels were enough for
him. But since the old man had given him leave, he would just help
himself to a few of the fine things. So he stuffed his pockets
full, and then he followed the old man up the steps and out into
the sunlight again.</p>

<p>It took him maybe an hour to count all the money and jewels he had
brought up with him. After he had done that, he began to wonder
what was inside of the little door at the back of the room. First
he wondered; then he began to grow curious; then he began to itch
and tingle and burn as though fifty thousand I-want-to-know nettles
were sticking into him from top to toe. At last he could stand it
no longer. “I’ll just go down yonder,” says he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span> “and peep through
the key-hole; perhaps I can see what is there without opening the
door.”</p>

<p>So down he took the key, and off he marched to the garden. He
opened the trap-door, and went down the steep steps to the room
below. There was the door at the end of the room, but when he came
to look there was no key-hole to it. “Pshaw!” said he, “here is a
pretty state of affairs. Tut! tut! tut! Well, since I have come so
far, it would be a pity to turn back without seeing more.” So he
opened the door and peeped in.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 121px;">

</div>

<p>“Pooh!” said the Fiddler, “there’s nothing there, after all,” and
he opened the door wide.</p>

<p>Before him was a great long passageway, and at the far end of it he
could see a spark of light as though the sun were shining there. He
listened, and after a while he heard a sound like the waves beating
on the shore. “Well,” says he, “this is the most curious thing I
have seen for a long time. Since I have come so far, I may as well
see the end of it.” So he entered the passageway, and closed the
door behind him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>He went on and on, and the spark of light kept growing larger and
larger, and by-and-by&mdash;pop! out he came at the other end of the
passage.</p>

<p>Sure enough, there he stood on the sea-shore, with the waves
beating and dashing on the rocks. He stood looking and wondering to
find himself in such a place, when all of a sudden something came
with a whiz and a rush and caught him by the belt, and away he flew
like a bullet.</p>

<p>By-and-by he managed to screw his head around and look up, and
there it was Ill-Luck that had him. “I thought so,” said the
Fiddler; and then he gave over kicking.</p>

<p>Well; on and on they flew, over hill and valley, over moor and
mountain, until they came to another garden, and there Ill-Luck let
the Fiddler drop.</p>

<p>Swash! Down he fell into the top of an apple-tree, and there he
hung in the branches.</p>

<p>It was the garden of a royal castle, and all had been weeping and
woe (though they were beginning now to pick up their smiles again),
and this was the reason why:</p>

<p>The king of that country had died, and no one was left behind him
but the queen. But she was a prize, for not only was the kingdom
hers, but she was as young as a spring apple and as pretty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span> as a
picture; so that there was no end of those who would have liked to
have had her, each man for his own. Even that day there were three
princes at the castle, each one wanting the queen to marry him; and
the wrangling and bickering and squabbling that was going on was
enough to deafen a body. The poor young queen was tired to death
with it all, and so she had come out into the garden for a bit of
rest; and there she sat under the shade of an apple-tree, fanning
herself and crying, when&mdash;</p>

<p>Swash! Down fell the Fiddler into the apple-tree and down fell a
dozen apples, popping and tumbling about the queen’s ears.</p>

<p>The queen looked up and screamed, and the Fiddler climbed down.</p>

<p>“Where did you come from?” said she.</p>

<p>“Oh, Ill-Luck brought me,” said the Fiddler.</p>

<p>“Nay,” said the queen, “do not say so. You fell from heaven, for I
saw it with my eyes and heard it with my ears. I see how it is now.
You were sent hither from heaven to be my husband, and my husband
you shall be. You shall be king of this country, half-and-half with
me as queen, and shall sit on a throne beside me.”</p>

<p>You can guess whether or not that was music to the Fiddler’s ears.</p>

<p>So the princes were sent packing, and the Fiddler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span> was married to
the queen, and reigned in that country.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 215px;">
<img src="images/i_b_091.png" width="215" height="500" alt="the queen sees the fiddler fall" />
</div>

<p>Well, three or four days passed, and all was as sweet and happy
as a spring day. But at the end of that time the Fiddler began to
wonder what was to be seen in the castle. The queen was very fond
of him, and was glad enough to show him all the fine things that
were to be seen; so hand in hand they went everywhere, from garret
to cellar.</p>

<p>But you should have seen how splendid it all was! The Fiddler felt
more certain than ever that it was better to be a king than to be
the richest man in the world, and he was as glad as glad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span> could be
that Ill-Luck had brought him from the rich little old man over
yonder to this.</p>

<p>So he saw everything in the castle but one thing. “What is behind
that door?” said he.</p>

<p>“Ah! that,” said the queen, “you must not ask or wish to know.
Should you open that door Ill-Luck will be sure to overtake you.”</p>

<p>“Pooh!” said the Fiddler, “I don’t care to know, anyhow,” and off
they went, hand in hand.</p>

<p>Yes, that was a very fine thing to say; but before an hour had
gone by the Fiddler’s head began to hum and buzz like a beehive.
“I don’t believe,” said he, “there would be a grain of harm in my
peeping inside that door; all the same, I will not do it. I will
just go down and peep through the key-hole.” So off he went to do
as he said; but there was no key-hole to that door, either. “Why,
look!” says he, “it is just like the door at the rich man’s house
over yonder; I wonder if it is the same inside as outside,” and he
opened the door and peeped in. Yes; there was the long passage and
the spark of light at the far end, as though the sun were shining.
He cocked his head to one side and listened. “Yes,” said he, “I
think I hear the water rushing, but I am not sure; I will just go
a little farther in and listen,” and so he entered and closed the
door behind him. Well, he went on and on until&mdash;pop!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span> there he was
out at the farther end, and before he knew what he was about he had
stepped out upon the sea-shore, just as he had done before.</p>

<p>Whiz! whirr! Away flew the Fiddler like a bullet, and there was
Ill-Luck carrying him by the belt again. Away they sped, over hill
and valley, over moor and mountain, until the Fiddler’s head grew
so dizzy that he had to shut his eyes. Suddenly Ill-Luck let him
drop, and down he fell&mdash;thump! bump!&mdash;on the hard ground. Then he
opened his eyes and sat up, and, lo and behold! there he was, under
the oak-tree whence he had started in the first place. There lay
his fiddle, just as he had left it. He picked it up and ran his
fingers over the strings&mdash;trum, twang! Then he got to his feet and
brushed the dirt and grass from his knees. He tucked his fiddle
under his arm, and off he stepped upon the way he had been going at
first.</p>

<p>“Just to think!” said he, “I would either have been the richest man
in the world, or else I would have been a king, if it had not been
for Ill-Luck.”</p>

<p>And that is the way we all of us talk.</p>

</div>

<p>In the old, old days when men were wiser than they are in these
times, there lived a great philosopher and magician, by name
Nicholas Flamel. Not only did he know all the actual sciences, but
the black arts as well, and magic, and what not. He conjured demons
so that when a body passed the house of a moonlight night a body
might see imps, great and small, little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span> and big, sitting on the
chimney stacks and the ridge-pole, clattering their heels on the
tiles and chatting together.</p>

<p>He could change iron and lead into silver and gold; he discovered
the elixir of life, and might have been living even to this day had
he thought it worth while to do so.</p>

<p>There was a student at the university whose name was Gebhart, who
was so well acquainted with algebra and geometry that he could tell
at a single glance how many drops of water there were in a bottle
of wine. As for Latin and Greek&mdash;he could patter them off like his
A B C’s. Nevertheless, he was not satisfied with the things he
knew, but was for learning the things that no schools could teach
him. So one day he came knocking at Nicholas Flamel’s door.</p>

<p>“Come in,” said the wise man, and there Gebhart found him sitting
in the midst of his books and bottles and diagrams and dust and
chemicals and cobwebs, making strange figures upon the table with
jackstraws and a piece of chalk&mdash;for your true wise man can squeeze
more learning out of jackstraws and a piece of chalk than we common
folk can get out of all the books in the world.</p>

<p>No one else was in the room but the wise man’s servant, whose name
was Babette.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 330px;">
<img src="images/i_b_097.png" width="330" height="500" alt="the wise man in the midst of his books and bottles" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>“What is it you want?” said the wise man, looking at Gebhart over
the rim of his spectacles.</p>

<p>“Master,” said Gebhart, “I have studied day after day at the
university, and from early in the morning until late at night,
so that my head has hummed and my eyes were sore, yet I have not
learned those things that I wish most of all to know&mdash;the arts that
no one but you can teach. Will you take me as your pupil?”</p>

<p>The wise man shook his head.</p>

<p>“Many would like to be as wise as that,” said he, “and few there be
who can become so. Now tell me. Suppose all the riches of the world
were offered to you, would you rather be wise?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Suppose you might have all the rank and power of a king or of an
emperor, would you rather be wise?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Suppose I undertook to teach you, would you give up everything of
joy and of pleasure to follow me?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are hungry,” said the master.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the student, “I am.”</p>

<p>“Then, Babette, you may bring some bread and cheese.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>It seemed to Gebhart that he had learned all that Nicholas Flamel
had to teach him.</p>

<p>It was in the gray of the dawning, and the master took the pupil
by the hand and led him up the rickety stairs to the roof of the
house, where nothing was to be seen but gray sky, high roofs, and
chimney stacks from which the smoke rose straight into the still
air.</p>

<p>“Now,” said the master, “I have taught you nearly all of the
science that I know, and the time has come to show you the
wonderful thing that has been waiting for us from the beginning
when time was. You have given up wealth and the world and pleasure
and joy and love for the sake of wisdom. Now, then, comes the last
test&mdash;whether you can remain faithful to me to the end; if you fail
in it, all is lost that you have gained.”</p>

<p>After he had said that he stripped his cloak away from his
shoulders and laid bare the skin. Then he took a bottle of red
liquor and began bathing his shoulder-blades with it; and as
Gebhart, squatting upon the ridge-pole, looked, he saw two little
lumps bud out upon the smooth skin, and then grow and grow and grow
until they became two great wings as white as snow.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 270px;">
<img src="images/i_b_101.png" width="270" height="500" alt="master and pupil on the roof" />
</div>

<p>“Now then,” said the master,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span> “take me by the belt and grip fast,
for there is a long, long journey before us, and if you should
lose your head and let go your hold you will fall and be dashed to
pieces.”</p>

<p>Then he spread the two great wings, and away he flew as fast as the
wind, with Gebhart hanging to his belt.</p>

<p>Over hills, over dales, over mountains, over moors he flew, with
the brown earth lying so far below that horses and cows looked like
pismires and men like fleas.</p>

<p>Then, by-and-by, it was over the ocean they were crossing, with the
great ships that pitched and tossed below looking like chips in a
puddle in rainy weather.</p>

<p>At last they came to a strange land, far, far away, and there the
master lit upon a sea-shore where the sand was as white as silver.
As soon as his feet touched the hard ground the great wings were
gone like a puff of smoke, and the wise man walked like any other
body.</p>

<p>At the edge of the sandy beach was a great, high, naked cliff; and
the only way of reaching the top was by a flight of stone steps, as
slippery as glass, cut in the solid rock.</p>

<p>The wise man led the way, and the student followed close at his
heels, every now and then slipping and stumbling so that, had it
not been for the help that the master gave him, he would have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>fallen more than once and have been dashed to pieces upon the
rocks below.</p>

<p>At last they reached the top, and there found themselves in a
desert, without stick of wood or blade of grass, but only gray
stones and skulls and bones bleaching in the sun.</p>

<p>In the middle of the plain was a castle such as the eyes of man
never saw before, for it was built all of crystal from roof to
cellar. Around it was a high wall of steel, and in the wall were
seven gates of polished brass.</p>

<p>The wise man led the way straight to the middle gate of the seven,
where there hung a horn of pure silver, which he set to his lips.
He blew a blast so loud and shrill that it made Gebhart’s ears
tingle. In an instant there sounded a great rumble and grumble like
the noise of loud thunder, and the gates of brass swung slowly
back, as though of themselves.</p>

<p>But when Gebhart saw what he saw within the gates his heart
crumbled away for fear, and his knees knocked together; for there,
in the very middle of the way, stood a monstrous, hideous dragon,
that blew out flames and clouds of smoke from his gaping mouth like
a chimney a-fire.</p>

<p>But the wise master was as cool as smooth water; he thrust his hand
into the bosom of his jacket and drew forth a little black box,
which he flung straight into the gaping mouth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 342px;">
<img src="images/i_b_103.png" width="342" height="500" alt="the master, the pupil, and the dragon" />
</div>

<p>Snap!&mdash;the dragon swallowed the box.</p>

<p>The next moment it gave a great, loud, terrible cry, and, clapping
and rattling its wings, leaped into the air and flew away,
bellowing like a bull.</p>

<p>If Gebhart had been wonder-struck at seeing the outside of the
castle, he was ten thousand times more amazed to see the inside
thereof. For, as the master led the way and he followed, he passed
through four-and-twenty rooms, each one more wonderful than the
other. Everywhere was gold and silver and dazzling jewels that
glistened so brightly that one had to shut one’s eyes to their
sparkle. Beside all this, there were silks and satins and velvets
and laces and crystal and ebony and sandal-wood that smelled
sweeter than musk and rose leaves. All the wealth of the world
brought together into one place could not make such riches as
Gebhart saw with his two eyes in these four-and-twenty rooms. His
heart beat fast within him.</p>

<p>At last they reached a little door of solid iron, beside which hung
a sword with a blade that shone like lightning. The master took the
sword in one hand and laid the other upon the latch of the door.
Then he turned to Gebhart and spoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span> for the first time since they
had started upon their long journey.</p>

<p>“In this room,” said he, “you will see a strange thing happen, and
in a little while I shall be as one dead. As soon as that comes
to pass, go you straightway through to the room beyond, where
you will find upon a marble table a goblet of water and a silver
dagger. Touch nothing else, and look at nothing else, for if you do
all will be lost to both of us. Bring the water straightway, and
sprinkle my face with it, and when that is done you and I will be
the wisest and greatest men that ever lived, for I will make you
equal to myself in all that I know. So now swear to do what I have
just bid you, and not turn aside a hair’s breadth in the going and
the coming.</p>

<p>“I swear,” said Gebhart, and crossed his heart.</p>

<p>Then the master opened the door and entered, with Gebhart close at
his heels.</p>

<p>In the centre of the room was a great red cock, with eyes that
shone like sparks of fire. So soon as he saw the master he flew
at him, screaming fearfully, and spitting out darts of fire that
blazed and sparkled like lightning.</p>

<p>It was a dreadful battle between the master and the cock. Up and
down they fought, and here and there. Sometimes the student could
see the wise man whirling and striking with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span> sword; and then
again he would be hidden in a sheet of flame. But after a while he
made a lucky stroke, and off flew the cock’s head. Then, lo and
behold! instead of a cock it was a great, hairy, black demon that
lay dead on the floor.</p>

<p>But, though the master had conquered, he looked like one sorely
sick. He was just able to stagger to a couch that stood by the
wall, and there he fell and lay, without breath or motion, like one
dead, and as white as wax.</p>

<p>As soon as Gebhart had gathered his wits together he remembered
what the master had said about the other room.</p>

<p>The door of it was also of iron. He opened it and passed within,
and there saw two great tables or blocks of polished marble. Upon
one was the dagger and a goblet of gold brimming with water. Upon
the other lay the figure of a woman, and as Gebhart looked at her
he thought her more beautiful than any thought or dream could
picture. But her eyes were closed, and she lay like a lifeless
figure of wax.</p>

<p>After Gebhart had gazed at her a long, long time, he took up the
goblet and the dagger from the table and turned towards the door.</p>

<p>Then, before he left that place, he thought that he would have
just one more look at the beautiful figure. So he did, and gazed
and gazed until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span> his heart melted away within him like a lump of
butter; and, hardly knowing what he did, he stooped and kissed the
lips.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_b_107.png" width="600" height="392" alt="Gebhart wakes the woman lying on a block of marble" />
</div>

<p>Instantly he did so a great humming sound filled the whole castle,
so sweet and musical that it made him tremble to listen. Then
suddenly the figure opened its eyes and looked straight at him.</p>

<p>“At last!” she said; “have you come at last?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Gebhart, “I have come.”</p>

<p>Then the beautiful woman arose and stepped down from the table to
the floor; and if Gebhart thought her beautiful before, he thought
her a thousand times more beautiful now that her eyes looked into
his.</p>

<p>“Listen,” said she. “I have been asleep for hundreds upon hundreds
of years, for so it was fated to be until he should come who was
to bring me back to life again. You are he, and now you shall live
with me forever. In this castle is the wealth gathered by the
king of the genii, and it is greater than all the riches of the
world. It and the castle likewise shall be yours. I can transport
everything into any part of the world you choose, and can by my
arts make you prince or king or emperor. Come.”</p>

<p>“Stop,” said Gebhart. “I must first do as my master bade me.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_b_109.png" width="600" height="383" alt="Gebhart raises the dagger to strike the master" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>He led the way into the other room, the lady following him, and so
they both stood together by the couch where the wise man lay. When
the lady saw his face she cried out in a loud voice: “It is the
great master! What are you going to do?”</p>

<p>“I am going to sprinkle his face with this water,” said Gebhart.</p>

<p>“Stop!” said she. “Listen to what I have to say. In your hand you
hold the water of life and the dagger of death. The master is
not dead, but sleeping; if you sprinkle that water upon him he
will awaken, young, handsome and more powerful than the greatest
magician that ever lived. I myself, this castle, and everything
that is in it will be his, and, instead of your becoming a prince
or a king or an emperor, he will be so in your place. That, I say,
will happen if he wakens. Now the dagger of death is the only thing
in the world that has power to kill him. You have it in your hand.
You have but to give him one stroke with it while he sleeps, and he
will never waken again, and then all will be yours&mdash;your very own.”</p>

<p>Gebhart neither spoke nor moved, but stood looking down upon his
master. Then he set down the goblet very softly on the floor, and,
shutting his eyes that he might not see the blow, raised the dagger
to strike.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>“That is all your promises amount to,” said Nicholas Flamel the
wise man. “After all, Babette, you need not bring the bread and
cheese, for he shall be no pupil of mine.”</p>

<p>Then Gebhart opened his eyes.</p>

<p>There sat the wise man in the midst of his books and bottles and
diagrams and dust and chemicals and cobwebs, making strange figures
upon the table with jackstraws and a piece of chalk.</p>

<p>And Babette, who had just opened the cupboard door for the loaf of
bread and the cheese, shut it again with a bang, and went back to
her spinning.</p>

<p>So Gebhart had to go back again to his Greek and Latin and algebra
and geometry; for, after all, one cannot pour a gallon of beer into
a quart pot, or the wisdom of a Nicholas Flamel into such an one as
Gebhart.</p>

<p>As for the name of this story, why, if some promises are not
bottles full of nothing but wind, there is little need to have a
name for anything.</p>

<p><i>Give a fool heaven and earth, and all the stars, and he will make
ducks and drakes of them.</i></p>


<p>Once upon a time there was an old man, who, by thrifty living and
long saving, had laid by a fortune great enough to buy ease and
comfort and pleasure for a lifetime.</p>

<p>By-and-by he died, and the money came to his son, who was of a
different sort from the father;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span> for, what that one had gained by
the labor of a whole year, the other spent in riotous living in one
week.</p>

<p>So it came about in a little while that the young man found himself
without so much as a single penny to bless himself withal. Then his
fair-weather friends left him, and the creditors came and seized
upon his house and his household goods, and turned him out into the
cold wide world to get along as best he might with the other fools
who lived there.</p>

<p>Now the young spendthrift was a strong, stout fellow, and, seeing
nothing better to do, he sold his fine clothes and bought him a
porter’s basket, and went and sat in the corner of the market-place
to hire himself out to carry this or that for folk who were better
off in the world, and less foolish than he.</p>

<p>There he sat, all day long, from morning until evening, but nobody
came to hire him. But at last, as dusk was settling, there came
along an old man with beard as white as snow hanging down below his
waist. He stopped in front of the foolish spendthrift, and stood
looking at him for a while; then, at last, seeming to be satisfied,
he beckoned with his finger to the young man. “Come,” said he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span> “I
have a task for you to do, and if you are wise, and keep a still
tongue in your head, I will pay you as never a porter was paid
before.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 404px;">
<img src="images/i_b_115.png" width="404" height="500" alt="the old man stops in front of the spendthrift" />
</div>

<p>You may depend upon it the young man needed no second bidding to
such a matter. Up he rose, and took his basket, and followed the
old man, who led the way up one street and down another, until at
last they came to a rickety, ramshackle house in a part of the
town the young man had never been before. Here the old man stopped
and knocked at the door, which was instantly opened, as though
of itself, and then he entered with the young spendthrift at his
heels. The two passed through a dark passage-way, and another
door, and then, lo and behold! all was changed; for they had come
suddenly into such a place as the young man would not have believed
could be in such a house, had he not seen it with his own eyes.
Thousands of waxen tapers lit the place as bright as day&mdash;a great
oval room, floored with mosaic of a thousand bright colors and
strange figures, and hung with tapestries of silks and satins and
gold and silver. The ceiling was painted to represent the sky,
through which flew beautiful birds and winged figures so life-like
that no one could tell that they were only painted, and not real.
At the farther side of the room were two richly cushioned couches,
and thither the old man led the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span> with the young spendthrift
following, wonder-struck, and there the two sat themselves down.
Then the old man smote his hands together, and, in answer, ten
young men and ten beautiful girls entered bearing a feast of rare
fruits and wines which they spread before them, and the young man,
who had been fasting since morning, fell to and ate as he had not
eaten for many a day.</p>

<p>The old man, who himself ate but little, waited patiently for the
other to end. “Now,” said he, as soon as the young man could eat no
more, “you have feasted and you have drunk; it is time for us to
work.”</p>

<p>Thereupon he rose from the couch and led the way, the young man
following, through an arch <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original read 'door-way'">doorway</ins> into a garden, in the centre of
which was an open space paved with white marble, and in the centre
of that again a carpet, ragged and worn, spread out upon the smooth
stones. Without saying a word, the old man seated himself upon one
end of this carpet, and motioned to the spendthrift to seat himself
with his basket at the other end; then&mdash;</p>

<p>“Are you ready?” said the old man.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the young man, “I am.”</p>

<p>“Then, by the horn of Jacob,” said the old man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span> “I command thee, O
Carpet! to bear us over hill and valley, over lake and river, to
that spot whither I wish to go.” Hardly had the words left his
mouth when away flew the carpet, swifter than the swiftest wind,
carrying the old man and the young spendthrift, until at last it
brought them to a rocky desert without leaf or blade of grass to be
seen far or near. Then it descended to where there was a circle of
sand as smooth as a floor.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 364px;">
<img src="images/i_b_118.png" width="364" height="250" alt="the old man and the spendthrift on the flying carpet" />
</div>

<p>The old man rolled up the carpet, and then drew from a pouch that
hung at his side a box, and from the box some sticks of sandal and
spice woods, with which he built a little fire. Next he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span> drew from
the same pouch a brazen jar, from which he poured a gray powder
upon the blaze. Instantly there leaped up a great flame of white
light and a cloud of smoke, which rose high in the air, and there
spread out until it hid everything from sight. Then the old man
began to mutter spells, and in answer the earth shook and quaked,
and a rumbling as of thunder filled the air. At last he gave a
loud cry, and instantly the earth split open, and there the young
spendthrift saw a trap-door of iron, in which was an iron ring to
lift it by.</p>

<p>“Look!” said the old man. “Yonder is the task for which I have
brought you; lift for me that trap-door of iron, for it is too
heavy for me to raise, and I will pay you well.”</p>

<p>And it was no small task, either, for, stout and strong as the
young man was, it was all he could do to lift up the iron plate.
But at last up it swung, and down below he saw a flight of stone
steps leading into the earth.</p>

<p>The old man drew from his bosom a copper lamp, which he lit at the
fire of the sandal and spice wood sticks, which had now nearly
died away. Then, leading the way, with the young man following
close at his heels, he descended the stairway that led down below.
At the bottom the two entered a great vaulted room, carved out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
of the solid stone, upon the walls of which were painted strange
pictures in bright colors of kings and queens, genii and dragons.
Excepting for these painted figures, the vaulted room was perfectly
bare, only that in the centre of the floor there stood three stone
tables. Upon the first table stood an iron candlestick with three
branches; upon the second stood an earthen jar, empty of everything
but dust; upon the third stood a brass bowl, a yard wide and a
yard deep, and filled to the brim with shining, gleaming, dazzling
jewels of all sorts.</p>

<p>“Now,” said the old man to the spendthrift, “I will do to you
as I promised: I will pay you as never man was paid before for
such a task. Yonder upon those three stone tables are three great
treasures: choose whichever one you will, and it is yours.”</p>

<p>“I shall not be long in choosing,” cried the young spendthrift. “I
shall choose the brass bowl of jewels.”</p>

<p>The old man laughed. “So be it,” said he. “Fill your basket from
the bowl with all you can carry, and that will be enough, provided
you live wisely, to make you rich for as long as you live.”</p>

<p>The young man needed no second bidding, but began filling his
basket with both hands, until he had in it as much as he could
carry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the old man, taking the iron candlestick and the earthen jar,
led the way up the stairway again. There the young man lowered the
iron trap-door to its place, and so soon as he had done so the
other stamped his heel upon the ground, and the earth closed of
itself as smooth and level as it had been before.</p>

<p>The two sat themselves upon the carpet, the one upon the one end,
and the other upon the other. “By the horn of Jacob,” said the old
man, “I command thee, O Carpet! to fly over hill and valley, over
lake and river, until thou hast brought us back whence we came.”</p>

<p>Away flew the carpet, and in a little time they were back in
the garden from which they had started upon their journey; and
there they parted company. “Go thy way, young man,” said the old
graybeard, “and henceforth try to live more wisely than thou hast
done heretofore. I know well who thou art, and how thou hast lived.
Shun thy evil companions, live soberly, and thou hast enough to
make thee rich for as long as thou livest.”</p>

<p>“Have no fear,” cried the young man, joyfully. “I have learned a
bitter lesson, and henceforth I will live wisely and well.”</p>

<p>So, filled with good resolves, the young man went the next day to
his creditors and paid his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span> debts; he bought back the house which
his father had left him, and there began to lead a new life as he
had promised.</p>

<p>But a gray goose does not become white, nor a foolish man a wise
one.</p>

<p>At first he led a life sober enough; but by little and little he
began to take up with his old-time friends again, and by-and-by the
money went flying as merrily as ever, only this time he was twenty
times richer than he had been before, and he spent his money twenty
times as fast. Every day there was feasting and drinking going on
in his house, and roaring and rioting and dancing and singing. The
wealth of a king could not keep up such a life forever, so by the
end of a year and a half the last of the treasure was gone, and the
young spendthrift was just as poor as ever. Then once again his
friends left him as they had done before, and all that he could do
was to rap his head and curse his folly.</p>

<p>At last, one morning, he plucked up courage to go to the old man
who had helped him once before, to see whether he would not help
him again. Rap! tap! tap! he knocked at the door, and who should
open it but the old man himself. “Well,” said the graybeard, “what
do you want?”</p>

<p>“I want some help,” said the spendthrift; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span> then he told him
all, and the old man listened and stroked his beard.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 420px;">
<img src="images/i_b_123.png" width="420" height="500" alt="feasting and drinking" />
</div>

<p>“By rights,” said he, when the young man had ended, “I should leave
you alone in your folly; for it is plain to see that nothing can
cure you of it. Nevertheless, as you helped me once, and as I have
more than I shall need, I will share what I have with you. Come in
and shut the door.”</p>

<p>He led the way, the spendthrift following, to a little room all of
bare stone, and in which were only three things&mdash;the magic carpet,
the iron candlestick, and the earthen jar. This last the old man
gave to the foolish spendthrift. “My friend,” said he, “when you
chose the money and jewels that day in the cavern, you chose the
less for the greater. Here is a treasure that an emperor might well
envy you. Whatever you wish for you will find by dipping your hand
into the jar. Now go your way, and let what has happened cure you
of your folly.”</p>

<p>“It shall,” cried the young man; “never again will I be so foolish
as I have been!” And thereupon he went his way with another
pocketful of good resolves.</p>

<p>The first thing he did when he reached home was to try the virtue
of his jar. “I should like,” said he, “to have a handful of just
such treasure as I brought from the cavern over yonder.” He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span> dipped
his hand into the jar, and when he brought it out again it was
brimful of shining, gleaming, sparkling jewels. You can guess how
he felt when he saw them.</p>

<p>Well, this time a whole year went by, during which the young man
lived as soberly as a judge. But at the end of the twelvemonth he
was so sick of wisdom that he loathed it as one loathes bitter
drink. Then by little and little he began to take up with his old
ways again, and to call his old cronies around, until at the end of
another twelvemonth things were a hundred times worse and wilder
than ever; for now what he had he had without end.</p>

<p>One day, when he and a great party of roisterers were shouting
and making merry, he brought out his earthen-ware pot to show
them the wonders of it; and to prove its virtue he gave to each
guest whatever he wanted. “What will you have?”&mdash;“A handful of
gold.”&mdash;“Put your hand in and get it!”&mdash;“What will you have?”&mdash;“A
fistful of pearls.”&mdash;“Put your fist in and get them!”&mdash;“What will
you have?”&mdash;“A necklace of diamonds.”&mdash;“Dip into the jar and get
it.” And so he went from one to another, and each and every one got
what he asked for, and such a shouting and hubbub those walls had
never heard before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the young man, holding the jar in his hands, began to dance
and to sing: “O wonderful jar! O beautiful jar! O beloved jar!” and
so on, his friends clapping their hands, and laughing and cheering
him. At last, in the height of his folly, he balanced the earthen
jar on his head, and began dancing around and around with it to
show his dexterity.</p>

<p>Smash! crash! The precious jar lay in fifty pieces on the stone
floor, and the young man stood staring at the result of his folly
with bulging eyes, while his friends roared and laughed and shouted
louder than ever over his mishap. And again his treasure and his
gay life were gone.</p>

<p>But what had been hard for him to do before was easier now. At the
end of a week he was back at the old man’s house, rapping on the
door. This time the old man asked him never a word, but frowned as
black as thunder.</p>

<p>“I know,” said he, “what has happened to you. If I were wise I
should let you alone in your folly; but once more I will have pity
on you and will help you, only this time it shall be the last.”
Once more he led the way to the stone room, where were the iron
candlestick and the magic carpet, and with him he took a good stout
cudgel. He stood the candlestick in the middle of the room, and
taking three candles from his pouch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span> thrust one into each branch.
Then he struck a light, and lit the first candle. Instantly there
appeared a little old man, clad in a long white robe, who began
dancing and spinning around and around like a top. He lit the
second candle, and a second old man appeared, and round and round
he went, spinning like his brother. He lit the third candle, and a
third old man appeared. Around and around and around they spun and
whirled, until the head spun and whirled to look at them. Then the
old graybeard gripped the cudgel in his hand. “Are you ready?” he
asked.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 459px;">
<img src="images/i_b_127.png" width="459" height="500" alt="young man dancing with an earthen jar on his head" />
</div>

<p>“We are ready, and waiting,” answered the three. Thereupon, without
another word, the graybeard fetched each of the dancers a blow upon
the head with might and main&mdash;One! two! three! crack! crash! jingle!</p>

<p>Lo and behold! Instead of the three dancing men, there lay three
great heaps of gold upon the floor, and the spendthrift stood
staring like an owl. “There,” said the old man, “take what you
want, and then go your way, and trouble me no more.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the spendthrift, “of all the wonders that ever I saw,
this is the most wonderful! But how am I to carry my gold away with
me, seeing I did not fetch my basket?”</p>

<p>“You shall have a basket,” said the old man, “if only you will
trouble me no more. Just wait here a moment until I bring it to
you.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 468px;">
<img src="images/i_b_129.png" width="468" height="500" alt="three old men spinning" />
</div>

<p>The spendthrift was left all alone in the room; not a soul was
there but himself. He looked up, and he looked down, and scratched
his head. “Why,” he cried aloud, “should I be content to take a
part when I can have the whole?”</p>

<p>To do was as easy as to say. He snatched up the iron candlestick,
caught up the staff that the old man had left leaning against the
wall, and seated himself upon the magic carpet. “By the horn of
Jacob,” he cried, “I command thee, O Carpet! to carry me over hill
and valley, over lake and river, to a place where the old man can
never find me.”</p>

<p>Hardly had the words left his mouth than away flew the carpet
through the air, carrying him along with it; away and away,
higher than the clouds and swifter than the wind. Then at last it
descended to the earth again, and when the young spendthrift looked
about him, he found himself in just such a desert place as he and
the old man had come to when they had found the treasure. But he
gave no thought to that, and hardly looked around him to see where
he was. All that he thought of was to try his hand at the three
dancers that belonged to the candlestick. He struck a light, and
lit the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span> three candles, and instantly the three little old men
appeared for him just as they had for the old graybeard. And around
and around they spun and whirled, until the sand and dust spun and
whirled along with them. Then the young man grasped his cudgel
tightly.</p>

<p>Now, he had not noticed that when the old man struck the three
dancers he had held the cudgel in his <em>left</em> hand, for he was
not wise enough to know that great differences come from little
matters. He griped the cudgel in his right hand, and struck the
dancers with might and main, just as the old man had done. Crack!
crack! crack! One; two; three.</p>

<p>Did they change into piles of gold? Not a bit of it! Each of the
dancers drew from under his robe a cudgel as stout and stouter than
the one the young man himself held, and, without a word, fell upon
him and began to beat and drub him until the dust flew. In vain he
hopped and howled and begged for mercy, in vain he tried to defend
himself; the three never stopped until he fell to the ground, and
laid there panting and sighing and groaning; and then they left and
flew back with the iron candlestick and the magic carpet to the old
man again. At last, after a great while, the young spendthrift sat
up, rubbing the sore places; but when he looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span> around not a sign
was to be seen of anything but the stony desert, without a house or
a man in sight.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 459px;">
<img src="images/i_b_133.png" width="459" height="500" alt="the spendthrift in the stony desert" />
</div>

<p>Perhaps, after a long time, he found his way home again, and
perhaps the drubbing he had had taught him wisdom; the first is a
likely enough thing to happen, but as for the second, it would need
three strong men to tell it to me a great many times before I would
believe it.</p>

<p>You may smile at this story if you like, but, all the same, as
certainly as there is meat in an egg-shell, so is there truth in
this nonsense. For, “Give a fool heaven and earth,” say I, “and all
the stars, and he will make ducks and drakes of them.”</p>

</div>


<p>There was one Beppo the Wise and another Beppo the Foolish.</p>

<p>The wise one was the father of the foolish one.</p>

<p>Beppo the Wise was called Beppo the Wise because he had laid up a
great treasure after a long life of hard work.</p>

<p>Beppo the Foolish was called Beppo the Foolish because he spent in
five years after his father was gone from this world of sorrow all
that the old man had laid together in his long life of toil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>But during that time Beppo lived as a prince, and the like was
never seen in that town before or since&mdash;feasting and drinking and
junketing and merrymaking. He had friends by the dozen and by the
scores, and the fame of his doings went throughout all the land.</p>

<p>While his money lasted he was called Beppo the Generous. It was
only after it was all gone that they called him Beppo the Foolish.</p>

<p>So by-and-by the money was spent, and there was an end of it.</p>

<p>Yes; there was an end of it; and where were all of Beppo’s
fair-weather friends? Gone like the wild-geese in frosty weather.</p>

<p>“Don’t you remember how I gave you a bagful of gold?” says Beppo
the Foolish. “Won’t you remember me now in my time of need?”</p>

<p>But the fair-weather friend only laughed in his face.</p>

<p>“Don’t you remember how I gave you a fine gold chain with a diamond
pendant?” says Beppo to another. “And won’t you lend me a little
money to help me over to-day?”</p>

<p>But the summer-goose friend only grinned.</p>

<p>“But what shall I do to keep body and soul together?” says Beppo to
a third.</p>

<p>The man was a wit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span> “Go to a shoemaker,” said he, “and let him
stitch the soul fast;” and that was all the good Beppo had of him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 449px;">
<img src="images/i_b_137.png" width="449" height="500" alt="Beppo feasting and drinking with his friends" />
</div>

<p>Then poor Beppo saw that there was not place for him in that town,
and so off he went to seek his fortune elsewhither, for he saw that
there was nothing to be gained in that place.</p>

<p>So he journeyed on for a week and a day, and then towards evening
he came to the king’s town.</p>

<p>There it stood on the hill beside the river&mdash;the grandest city in
the kingdom. There were orchards and plantations of trees along the
banks of the stream, and gardens and summer-houses and pavilions.
There were white houses and red roofs and blue skies. Up above on
the hill were olive orchards and fields, and then blue sky again.</p>

<p>Beppo went into the town, gazing about him with admiration. Houses,
palaces, gardens. He had never seen the like. Stores and shops full
of cloths of velvet and silk and satin; goldsmiths, silversmiths,
jewellers&mdash;as though all the riches of the world had been emptied
into the city. Crowds of people&mdash;lords, noblemen, courtiers, rich
merchants, and tradesmen.</p>

<p>Beppo stared about at the fine sights and everybody stared at
Beppo, for his shoes were dusty, his clothes were travel-stained,
and a razor had not touched his face for a week.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>The king of that country was walking in the garden under the shade
of the trees, and the sunlight slanted down upon him, and sparkled
upon the jewels around his neck and on his fingers. Two dogs
walked alongside of him, and a whole crowd of lords and nobles and
courtiers came behind him; first of all the prime-minister with his
long staff.</p>

<p>But for all this fine show this king was not really the king. When
the old king died he left a daughter, and she should have been
queen if she had had her own rights. But this king, who was her
uncle, had stepped in before her, and so the poor princess was
pushed aside and was nobody at all but a princess, the king’s niece.</p>

<p>She stood on the terrace with her old nurse, while the king walked
in the garden below.</p>

<p>It had been seven years now since the old king had died, and in
that time she had grown up into a beautiful young woman, as wise
as she was beautiful, and as good as she was wise. Few people ever
saw her, but everybody talked about her in whispers and praised her
beauty and goodness, saying that, if the right were done, she would
have her own and be queen.</p>

<p>Sometimes the king heard of this (for a king hears everything), and
he grew to hate the princess as a man hates bitter drink.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>The princess looked down from the terrace, and there she saw Beppo
walking along the street, and his shoes were dusty and his clothes
were travel-stained, and a razor had not touched his face for a
week.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 327px;">
<img src="images/i_b_141.png" width="327" height="500" alt="the princess on the terrace with her old nurse" />
</div>

<p>“Look at yonder poor man,” she said to her nurse; “yet if I were
his wife he would be greater really than my uncle, the king.”</p>

<p>The king, walking below in the garden, heard what she said.</p>

<p>“Say you so!” he called out. “Then we shall try if what you say is
true;” and he turned away, shaking with anger.</p>

<p>“Alas!” said the princess, “now, indeed, have I ruined myself for
good and all.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Beppo was walking along the street looking about him hither and
thither, and thinking how fine it all was. He had no more thought
that the king and the princess were talking about him than the man
in the moon.</p>

<p>Suddenly some one clapped him upon the shoulder.</p>

<p>Beppo turned around.</p>

<p>There stood a great tall man dressed all in black.</p>

<p>“You must come with me,” said he.</p>

<p>“What do you want with me?” said Beppo.</p>

<p>“That you shall see for yourself,” said the man.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>“Very well,” said Beppo; “I’d as lief go along with you as anywhere
else.”</p>

<p>So he turned and followed the man whither he led.</p>

<p>They went along first one street and then another, and by-and-by
they came to the river, and there was a long wall with a gate in
it. The tall man in black knocked upon the gate, and some one
opened it from within. The man in black entered, and Beppo followed
at his heels, wondering where he was going.</p>

<p>He was in a garden. There were fruit trees and flowering shrubs and
long marble walks, and away in the distance a great grand palace
of white marble that shone red as fire in the light of the setting
sun, but there was not a soul to be seen anywhere.</p>

<p>The tall man in black led the way up the long marble walk, past the
fountains and fruit trees and beds of roses, until he had come to
the palace.</p>

<p>Beppo wondered whether he were dreaming.</p>

<p>The tall man in black led the way into the palace, but still there
was not a soul to be seen.</p>

<p>Beppo gazed about him in wonder. There were floors of colored
marble, and ceilings of blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span> and gold, and columns of carved
marble, and hangings of silk and velvet and silver.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 309px;">
<img src="images/i_b_143.png" width="309" height="500" alt="Beppo with the tall man man in black passing through a gate in the wall" />
</div>

<p>Suddenly the tall man opened a little door that led into a dark
passage, and Beppo followed him. They went along the passage, and
then the man opened another door.</p>

<p>Then Beppo found himself in a great vaulted room. There at one end
of the room were three souls. A man sat on the throne, and he was
the king, for he had a crown on his head and a long robe over his
shoulders. Beside him stood a priest, and in front of him stood a
beautiful young woman as white as wax and as still as death.</p>

<p>Beppo wondered whether he were awake.</p>

<p>“Come hither,” said the king, in a harsh voice, and Beppo came
forward and kneeled before him. “Take this young woman by the
hand,” said the king.</p>

<p>Beppo did as he was bidden.</p>

<p>Her hand was as cold as ice.</p>

<p>Then, before Beppo knew what was happening, he found that he was
being married.</p>

<p>It was the princess.</p>

<p>“Now,” said the king to her when the priest had ended, and he
frowned until his brows were as black as thunder&mdash;“now you are
married; tell me, is your husband greater than I?”</p>

<p>But the princess said never a word, only the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span> tears ran one after
another down her white face. The king sat staring at her and
frowning.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 329px;">
<img src="images/i_b_145.png" width="329" height="500" alt="Beppo kneeling to the king" />
</div>

<p>Suddenly some one tapped Beppo upon the shoulder. It was the tall
man in black.</p>

<p>Beppo knew that he was to follow him again. This time the princess
was to go along. The tall man in black led the way, and Beppo and
the princess followed along the secret passage and up and down the
stairs until at last they came out into the garden again.</p>

<p>And now the evening was beginning to fall.</p>

<p>The man led the way down the garden to the river, and still Beppo
and the princess followed him.</p>

<p>By-and-by they came to the river-side and to a flight of steps, and
there was a little frail boat without sail or oars.</p>

<p>The tall man in black beckoned towards the boat, and Beppo knew
that he and the princess were to enter it.</p>

<p>As soon as Beppo had helped the princess into the boat the tall man
thrust it out into the stream with his foot, and the boat drifted
away from the shore and out into the river, and then around and
around. Then it floated off down the stream.</p>

<p>It floated on and on, and the sun set and the moon rose.</p>

<p>Beppo looked at the princess, and he thought he had never seen
any one so beautiful in all his life. It was all like a dream, and
he hoped he might never awaken. But the princess sat there weeping
and weeping, and said nothing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 306px;">
<img src="images/i_b_147.png" width="306" height="500" alt="the princess and Beppo" />
</div>

<p>The night fell darker and darker, but still Beppo sat looking at
the princess. Her face was as white as silver in the moonlight.
The smell of the flower-gardens came across the river. The boat
floated on and on until by-and-by it drifted to the shore again and
among the river reeds, and there it stopped, and Beppo carried the
princess ashore.</p>

<p>“Listen,” said the princess. “Do you know who I am?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Beppo, “I do not.”</p>

<p>“I am the princess,” said she, “the king’s niece; and by rights I
should be queen of this land.”</p>

<p>Beppo could not believe his ears.</p>

<p>“It is true that I am married to you,” said she, “but never shall
you be my husband until you are king.”</p>

<p>“King!” said Beppo; “how can I be king?”</p>

<p>“You shall be king,” said the princess.</p>

<p>“But the king is everything,” said Beppo, “and I am nothing at all.”</p>

<p>“Great things come from small beginnings,” said the princess;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span> “a
big tree from a little seed.”</p>

<p>Some little distance away from the river was the twinkle of a
light, and thither Beppo led the princess. When the two came to it,
they found it was a little hut, for there were fish-nets hanging
outside in the moonlight.</p>

<p>Beppo knocked.</p>

<p>An old woman opened the door. She stared and stared, as well she
might, to see the fine lady in silks and satins with a gold ring
upon her finger, and nobody with her but one who looked like a poor
beggar-man.</p>

<p>“Who are you and what do you want?” said the old woman.</p>

<p>“Who we are,” said the princess, “does not matter, except that we
are honest folk in trouble. What we want is shelter for the night
and food to eat, and that we will pay for.”</p>

<p>“Shelter I can give you,” said the old woman, “but little else but
a crust of bread and a cup of water. One time there was enough and
plenty in the house; but now, since my husband has gone and I am
left all alone, it is little I have to eat and drink. But such as I
have to give you are welcome to.”</p>

<p>Then Beppo and the princess went into the house.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next morning the princess called Beppo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span> to her. “Here,” said
she, “is a ring and a letter. Go you into the town and inquire for
Sebastian the Goldsmith. He will know what to do.”</p>

<p>Beppo took the ring and the letter and started off to town, and it
was not hard for him to find the man he sought, for every one knew
of Sebastian the Goldsmith. He was an old man, with a great white
beard and a forehead like the dome of a temple. He looked at Beppo
from head to foot with eyes as bright as those of a snake; then he
took the ring and the letter. As soon as he saw the ring he raised
it to his lips and kissed it; then he kissed the letter also; then
he opened it and read it.</p>

<p>He turned to Beppo and bowed very low. “My lord,” said he, “I will
do as I am commanded. Will you be pleased to follow me?”</p>

<p>He led the way into an inner room. There were soft rugs upon the
floor, and around the walls were tapestries. There were couches and
silken cushions. Beppo wondered what it all meant.</p>

<p>Sebastian the Goldsmith clapped his hands together. A door opened,
and there came three black slaves into the room. The Goldsmith
spoke to them in a strange language, and the chief of the three
black slaves bowed in reply. Then he and the others led Beppo into
another room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span> where there was a marble bath of tepid water. They
bathed him and rubbed him with soft linen towels; then they shaved
the beard from his cheeks and chin and trimmed his hair; then they
clothed him in fine linen and a plain suit of gray and Beppo looked
like a new man.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 388px;">
<img src="images/i_b_151.png" width="388" height="500" alt="Beppo sat down to the feast" />
</div>

<p>Then when all this was done the chief of the blacks conducted Beppo
back to Sebastian the Goldsmith. There was a fine feast spread,
with fruit and wine. Beppo sat down to it, and Sebastian the
Goldsmith stood and served him with a napkin over his arm.</p>

<p>Then Beppo was to return to the princess again.</p>

<p>A milk-white horse was waiting for him at the Goldsmith’s door, a
servant holding the bridle, and Beppo mounted and rode away.</p>

<p>When he returned to the fisherman’s hut the princess was waiting
for him. She had prepared a tray spread with a napkin, a cup of
milk, and some sweet cakes.</p>

<p>“Listen,” said she;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span> “to-day the king hunts in the forest over
yonder. Go you thither with this. The king will be hot and thirsty,
and weary with the chase. Offer him this refreshment. He will eat
and drink, and in gratitude he will offer you something in return.
Take nothing of him, but ask him this: that he allow you once every
three days to come to the palace, and that he whisper these words
in your ear so that no one else may hear them&mdash;‘A word, a word,
only a few words; spoken ill, they are ill; spoken well, they are
more precious than gold and jewels.’”</p>

<p>“Why should I do that?” said Beppo.</p>

<p>“You will see,” said the princess.</p>

<p>Beppo did not understand it at all, but the princess is a princess
and must be obeyed, and so he rode away on his horse at her bidding.</p>

<p>It was as the princess had said: the king was hunting in the
forest, and when Beppo came there he could hear the shouts of the
men and the winding of horns and the baying of dogs. He waited
there for maybe an hour or more, and sometimes the sounds were
nearer and sometimes the sounds were farther away. Presently they
came nearer and nearer, and then all of a sudden the king came
riding out of the forest, the hounds hunting hither and thither,
and the lords and nobles and courtiers following him.</p>

<p>The king’s face was flushed and heated with the chase, and his
forehead was bedewed with sweat. Beppo came forward and offered the
tray. The king wiped his face with the napkin, and then drank the
milk and ate three of the cakes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 389px;">
<img src="images/i_b_155.png" width="389" height="500" alt="Beppo offering the tray to the king" />
</div>

<p>“Who was it ordered you to bring this to me?” said he to Beppo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>“No one,” said Beppo; “I brought it myself.”</p>

<p>The king looked at Beppo and was grateful to him.</p>

<p>“Thou hast given me pleasure and comfort,” said he; “ask what thou
wilt in return and if it is in reason thou shalt have it.”</p>

<p>“I will have only this,” said Beppo: “that your majesty will allow
me once every three days to come to the palace, and that then you
will take me aside and will whisper these words into my ear so
that no one else may hear them&mdash;‘A word, a word, only a few words;
spoken ill, they are ill; spoken well, they are more precious than
gold and jewels.’”</p>

<p>The king burst out laughing. “Why,” said he, “what is this foolish
thing you ask of me? If you had asked for a hundred pieces of gold
you should have had them. Think better, friend, and ask something
of more worth than this foolish thing.”</p>

<p>“Please your majesty,” said Beppo, “I ask nothing else.”</p>

<p>The king laughed again. “Then you shall have what you ask,” said
he, and he rode away.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next morning the princess said to Beppo:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span> “This day you shall go
and claim the king’s promise of him. Take this ring and this letter
again to Sebastian the Goldsmith. He will fit you with clothes in
which to appear before the king. Then go to the king’s palace that
he may whisper those words he has to say into your ear.”</p>

<p>Once more Beppo went to Sebastian the Goldsmith, and the Goldsmith
kissed the princess’s ring and letter, and then read what she had
written.</p>

<p>Again the black slaves took Beppo to the bath, only this time they
clad him in a fine suit of velvet and hung a gold chain about his
neck. After that Sebastian the Goldsmith again served a feast to
Beppo, and waited upon him while he ate and drank.</p>

<p>In front of the house a noble horse, as black as jet, was waiting
to carry Beppo to the palace, and two servants dressed in velvet
livery were waiting to attend him.</p>

<p>So Beppo rode away, and many people stopped to look at him.</p>

<p>He came to the palace, and the king was giving audience. Beppo went
into the great audience-chamber. It was full of people&mdash;lords and
nobles and rich merchants and lawyers.</p>

<p>Beppo did not know how to come to the king, so he stood there and
waited and waited. The people looked at him and whispered to one
another: “Who is that young man?” “Whence comes he?” Then one said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
“Is not he the young man who served the king with cakes and milk
in the forest yesterday?”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 356px;">
<img src="images/i_b_157.png" width="356" height="500" alt="the king whispers to Beppo" />
</div>

<p>Beppo stood there gazing at the king. By-and-by the king suddenly
looked up and caught sight of him. He gazed at Beppo for a moment
or two and then he knew him. Then he smiled and beckoned to him.</p>

<p>“Aye, my foolish benefactor,” said he, aloud, “is it thou, and art
thou come so soon to redeem thy promise? Very well; come hither, I
have something to say to thee.”</p>

<p>Beppo came forward, and everybody stared. He came close to the
king, and the king laid his hand upon his shoulder. Then he leaned
over to Beppo and whispered in his ear: “A word, a word, only a few
words; if they be spoken ill, they are ill; if they be spoken well,
they are more precious than gold and jewels.” Then he laughed. “Is
that what you would have me say?” said he.</p>

<p>“Yes, majesty,” said Beppo, and he bowed low and withdrew.</p>

<p>But, lo and behold, what a change!</p>

<p>Suddenly he was transformed in the eyes of the whole world. The
crowd drew back to allow him to pass, and everybody bowed low as he
went along.</p>

<p>“Did you not see the king whisper to him,” said one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span> “What could
it be that the king said?” said another. “This must be a new
favorite,” said a third.</p>

<p>He had come into the palace Beppo the Foolish; he went forth
Beppo the Great Man, and all because of a few words the king had
whispered in his ear.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Three days passed, and then Beppo went again to the Goldsmith’s
with the ring and a letter from the princess. This time Sebastian
the Goldsmith fitted him with a suit of splendid plum-colored
silk and gave him a dappled horse, and again Beppo and his two
attendants rode away to the palace. And this time every one knew
him, and as he went up the steps into the palace all present bowed
to him. The king saw him as soon as he appeared, and when he caught
sight of him he burst out laughing.</p>

<p>“Aye,” said he, “I was looking for thee to-day, and wondering how
soon thou wouldst come. Come hither till I whisper something in
thine ear.”</p>

<p>Then all the lords and nobles and courtiers and ministers drew
back, and Beppo went up to the king.</p>

<p>The king laughed and laughed. He laid his arm over Beppo’s
shoulder, and again he whispered in his ear:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span> “A word, a word, only
a few words; if they be spoken ill, they are ill; if they be
spoken well, they are more precious than gold and jewels.”</p>

<p>Then he released Beppo, and Beppo withdrew.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So it continued for three months. Every three days Beppo went to
the palace, and the king whispered the words in his ear. Beppo said
nothing to any one, and always went away as soon as the king had
whispered to him.</p>

<p>Then at last the princess said to him: “Now the time is ripe for
doing. Listen! To-day when you go to the palace fix your eyes,
when the king speaks to you, upon the prime-minister, and shake
your head. The prime-minister will ask you what the king said. Say
nothing to him but this: ‘Alas, my poor friend!’”</p>

<p>It was all just as the princess had said.</p>

<p>The king was walking in the garden, with his courtiers and
ministers about him. Beppo came to him, and the king, as he always
did, laid his hand upon Beppo’s shoulder and whispered in his ear:
“A word, a word, only a few words; if they be spoken ill, they are
ill; if they be spoken well, they are more precious than gold and
jewels.”</p>

<p>While the king was saying these words to Beppo, Beppo was looking
fixedly at the prime-minister. While he did so he shook his head
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>three times. Then he bowed low and walked away.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 329px;">
<img src="images/i_b_161.png" width="329" height="500" alt="the prime-minister taps Beppo on the arm" />
</div>

<p>He had not gone twenty paces before some one tapped him upon the
arm; it was the prime-minister. Beppo gazed fixedly at him. “Alas,
my poor friend!” said he.</p>

<p>The prime-minister turned pale. “It was, then, as I thought,” said
he. “The king spoke about me. Will you not tell me what he said?”</p>

<p>Beppo shook his head. “Alas, my poor friend!” said he, and then he
walked on.</p>

<p>The prime-minister still followed him.</p>

<p>“My lord,” said he, “I have been aware that his majesty has not
been the same to me for more than a week past. If it was about the
princess, pray tell his majesty that I meant nothing ill when I
spoke of her to him.”</p>

<p>Beppo shook his head. “Alas, my poor friend!” he said.</p>

<p>The prime-minister’s lips trembled. “My lord,” said he, “I have
always had the kindest regard for you, and if there is anything in
my power that I can do for you I hope you will command me. I know
how much you are in his majesty’s confidence. Will you not speak a
few words to set the matter straight?”</p>

<p>Beppo again shook his head.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span> “Alas, my poor friend!” said he, and
then he got upon his horse and rode away.</p>

<p>Three days passed.</p>

<p>“This morning,” said the princess, “when you go to the king, look
at the prime-minister when the king speaks to you, and smile. The
prime-minister will again speak to you, and this time say, ‘It is
well, and I wish you joy.’ Take what he gives you, for it will be
of use.”</p>

<p>Again all happened just as the princess said.</p>

<p>Beppo came to the palace, and again the king whispered in his ear.
As he did so Beppo looked at the prime-minister and smiled, and
then he withdrew.</p>

<p>The prime-minister followed him. He trembled. “It is well,” said
Beppo, “and I wish you joy.”</p>

<p>The prime-minister grasped his hand and wrung it. “My lord,” said
he, “how can I express my gratitude! The palace of my son that
stands by the river&mdash;I would that you would use it for your own, if
I may be so bold as to offer it to you.”</p>

<p>“I will,” said Beppo, “use it as my own.”</p>

<p>The prime-minister wrung his hand again, and then Beppo rode away.</p>

<p>The next time that Beppo spoke to the king, at the princess’s
bidding, he looked at the lord-treasurer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span> and said, as he had said
to the prime-minister, “Alas, my poor friend!”</p>

<p>When he rode away he left the lord-treasurer as white as ashes to
the very lips.</p>

<p>Three days passed, and then, while the king talked to Beppo, Beppo
looked at the lord-treasurer and smiled.</p>

<p>The lord-treasurer followed him to the door of the palace.</p>

<p>“It is well, and I wish you joy,” said Beppo.</p>

<p>The treasurer offered him a fortune.</p>

<p>The next time it was the same with the captain of the guards. First
Beppo pitied him, and then he wished him joy.</p>

<p>“My lord,” said the captain of the guards, “my services are yours
at any time.”</p>

<p>Then the same thing happened to the governor of the city, then to
this lord, and then to that lord.</p>

<p>Beppo grew rich and powerful beyond measure.</p>

<p>Then one day the princess said: “Now we will go into the town, and
to the palace of the prime-minister’s son, which the prime-minister
gave you, for the time is ripe for the end.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In a few days all the court knew that Beppo was living like a
prince in the prime-minister’s palace. The king began to wonder
what it all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span> meant, and how all such good-fortune had come to
Beppo. He had grown very tired of always speaking to Beppo the same
words.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 381px;">
<img src="images/i_b_165.png" width="381" height="500" alt="Beppo came into the room, leading a veiled lady" />
</div>

<p>But Beppo was now great among the great; all the world paid court
to him, and bowed down to him, almost as they did before the king.</p>

<p>“Now,” said the princess, “the time has come to strike. Bid all the
councillors, and all the lords, and all the nobles to meet here
three days hence, for it is now or never that you shall win all and
become king.”</p>

<p>Beppo did as she bade. He asked all of the great people of the
kingdom to come to him, and they came. When they were all gathered
together at Beppo’s house, they found two thrones set as though for
a king and a queen, but there was no sign of Beppo, and everybody
wondered what it all meant.</p>

<p>Suddenly the door opened and Beppo came into the room, leading by
the hand a lady covered with a veil from head to foot.</p>

<p>Everybody stopped speaking and stood staring while Beppo led the
veiled lady up to one of the thrones. He seated himself upon the
other.</p>

<p>The lady stood up and dropped her veil, and then every one knew her.</p>

<p>It was the princess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you not know me?” said she; “I am the queen, and this is my
husband. He is your king.”</p>

<p>All stood silent for a moment, and then a great shout went up.
“Long live the queen! Long live the king!”</p>

<p>The princess turned to the captain of the guards. “You have offered
your services to my husband,” said she; “his commands and my
commands are that you march to the palace and cast out him who hath
no right there.”</p>

<p>“It shall be done,” said the captain of the guards.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>All the troops were up in arms, and the town was full of tumult and
confusion. About midnight they brought the false king before King
Beppo and the queen. The false king stood there trembling like a
leaf. The queen stood gazing at him steadily. “Behold, this is the
husband that thou gavest me,” said she. “It is as I said; he is
greater than thou. For, lo, he is king! What art thou?”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The false king was banished out of the country, and the poor
fisherman’s wife, who had entertained the princess for all this
time, came to live at the palace, where all was joy and happiness.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>


<p>“<i>Friend,” said St. George, “I like your story. Ne’th’less, ’tis
like a strolling pedler, in that it carries a great pack of ills
to begin with, to get rid of ’em all before it gets to the end
of its journey. However, ’tis as you say&mdash;it ends with everybody
merry and feasting, and so I like it. But now methinks our little
friend yonder is big with a story of his own;” and he pointed, as
he spoke, with the stem of his pipe to a little man whom I knew was
the brave Tailor who had killed seven flies at a blow, for he still
had around his waist the belt with the legend that he himself had
worked upon it.</i></p>

<p><i>“Aye,” piped the Tailor in a keen, high voice, “’tis true I have a
story inside of me. ’Tis about another tailor who had a great, big,
black, ugly demon to wait upon him and to sew his clothes for him.”</i></p>

<p><i>“And the name of that story, my friend,” said the Soldier who had
cheated the Devil, “is what?”</i></p>

<p><i>“It hath no name,” piped the little Tailor, “but I will give it
one, and it shall be&mdash;”</i></p>

</div>

<p><strong>When man’s strength fails, woman’s wit prevails.</strong></p>


<p>In the days when the great and wise King Solomon lived and ruled,
evil spirits and demons were as plentiful in the world as wasps in
summer.</p>

<p>So King Solomon, who was so wise and knew so many potent spells
that he had power over evil such as no man has had before or since,
set himself to work to put those enemies of mankind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span> out of the
way. Some he conjured into bottles, and sank into the depths of the
sea; some he buried in the earth; some he destroyed altogether, as
one burns hair in a candle-flame.</p>

<p>Now, one pleasant day when King Solomon was walking in his garden
with his hands behind his back, and his thoughts busy as bees with
this or that, he came face to face with a Demon, who was a prince
of his kind. “Ho, little man!” cried the evil spirit, in a loud
voice, “art not thou the wise King Solomon who conjures my brethren
into brass chests and glass bottles? Come, try a fall at wrestling
with me, and whoever conquers shall be master over the other for
all time. What do you say to such an offer as that?”</p>

<p>“I say aye!” said King Solomon, and, without another word, he
stripped off his royal robes and stood bare breasted, man to man
with the other.</p>

<p>The world never saw the like of that wrestling-match betwixt the
king and the Demon, for they struggled and strove together from
the seventh hour in the morning to the sunset in the evening, and
during that time the sky was clouded over as black as night, and
the lightning forked and shot, and the thunder roared and bellowed,
and the earth shook and quaked.</p>

<p>But at last the king gave the enemy an under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span> twist, and flung him
down on the earth so hard that the apples fell from the trees; and
then, panting and straining, he held the evil one down, knee on
neck. Thereupon the sky presently cleared again, and all was as
pleasant as a spring day.</p>

<p>King Solomon bound the Demon with spells, and made him serve him
for seven years. First, he had him build a splendid palace, the
like of which was not to be seen within the bounds of the seven
rivers; then he made him set around the palace a garden, such as I
for one wish I may see some time or other. Then, when the Demon had
done all that the king wished, the king conjured him into a bottle,
corked it tightly, and set the royal seal on the stopper. Then he
took the bottle a thousand miles away into the wilderness, and,
when no man was looking, buried it in the ground, and this is the
way the story begins.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Well, the years came and the years went, and the world grew older
and older, and kept changing (as all things do but two), so that
by-and-by the wilderness where King Solomon had hid the bottle
became a great town, with people coming and going, and all as busy
as bees about their own business and other folks’ affairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>Among these towns-people was a little Tailor, who made clothes for
many a worse man to wear, and who lived all alone in a little house
with no one to darn his stockings for him, and no one to meddle
with his coming and going, for he was a bachelor.</p>

<p>The little Tailor was a thrifty soul, and by hook and crook had
laid by enough money to fill a small pot, and then he had to
bethink himself of some safe place to hide it. So one night he took
a spade and a lamp and went out in the garden to bury his money.
He drove his spade into the ground&mdash;and click! He struck something
hard that rang under his foot with a sound as of iron. “Hello!”
said he, “what have we here?” and if he had known as much as you
and I do, he would have filled in the earth, and tramped it down,
and have left that plate of broth for somebody else to burn his
mouth with.</p>

<p>As it was, he scraped away the soil, and then he found a box of
adamant, with a ring in the lid to lift it by. The Tailor clutched
the ring and bent his back, and up came the box with the damp
earth sticking to it. He cleaned the mould away, and there he saw,
written in red letters, these words:</p>

<p class="center">“<em>Open not.</em>”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 303px;">
<img src="images/i_b_173.png" width="303" height="500" alt="the tailor finds a box with a ring for carrying it" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>You may be sure that after he had read these words he was not long
in breaking open the lid of the box with his spade.</p>

<p>Inside the first box he found a second, and upon it the same words:</p>

<p class="center">“<em>Open not.</em>”</p>

<p>Within the second box was another, and within that still another,
until there were seven in all, and on each was written the same
words:</p>

<p class="center">“<em>Open not.</em>”</p>

<p>Inside the seventh box was a roll of linen, and inside that a
bottle filled with nothing but blue smoke; and I wish that bottle
had burned the Tailor’s fingers when he touched it.</p>

<p>“And is this all?” said the little Tailor, turning the bottle
upside down and shaking it, and peeping at it by the light of the
lamp. “Well, since I have gone so far I might as well open it, as I
have already opened the seven boxes.” Thereupon he broke the seal
that stoppered it.</p>

<p>Pop! Out flew the cork, and&mdash;Puff! Out came the smoke; not all at
once, but in a long thread that rose up as high as the stars, and
then spread until it hid their light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>The Tailor stared and goggled and gaped to see so much smoke come
out of such a little bottle, and, as he goggled and stared, the
smoke began to gather together again, thicker and thicker, and
darker and darker, until it was as black as ink. Then out from it
there stepped one with eyes that shone like sparks of fire, and who
had a countenance so terrible that the Tailor’s skin quivered and
shrivelled, and his tongue clove to the roof of his mouth at the
sight of it.</p>

<p>“Who art thou?” said the terrible being, in a voice that made the
very marrow of the poor Tailor’s bones turn soft from terror.</p>

<p>“If you please, sir,” said he, “I am only a little tailor.”</p>

<p>The evil being lifted up both hands and eyes. “How wonderful,” he
cried, “that one little tailor can undo in a moment that which took
the wise Solomon a whole day to accomplish, and in the doing of
which he wellnigh broke the sinews of his heart!” Then, turning to
the Tailor, who stood trembling like a rabbit, “Hark thee!” said
he.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span> “For two thousand years I lay there in that bottle, and no one
came nigh to aid me. Thou hast liberated me, and thou shalt not go
unrewarded. Every morning at the seventh hour I will come to thee,
and I will perform for thee whatever task thou mayest command me.
But there is one condition attached to the agreement, and woe be to
thee if that condition is broken. If any morning I should come to
thee, and thou hast no task for me to do, I shall wring thy neck as
thou mightest wring the neck of a sparrow.” Thereupon he was gone
in an instant, leaving the little Tailor half dead with terror.</p>

<p>Now it happened that the prime-minister of that country had left an
order with the Tailor for a suit of clothes, so the next morning,
when the Demon came, the little man set him to work on the bench,
with his legs tucked up like a journeyman tailor. “I want,” said
he, “such and such a suit of clothes.”</p>

<p>“You shall have them,” said the Demon; and thereupon he began
snipping in the air, and cutting most wonderful patterns of silks
and satins out of nothing at all, and the little Tailor sat and
gaped and stared. Then the Demon began to drive the needle like a
spark of fire&mdash;the like was never seen in all the seven kingdoms,
for the clothes seemed to make themselves.</p>

<p>At last, at the end of a little while, the Demon stood up and
brushed his hands. “They are done,” said he, and thereupon he
instantly vanished. But the Tailor cared little for that, for upon
the bench there lay such a suit of clothes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span> of silk and satin
stuff, sewed with threads of gold and silver and set with jewels,
as the eyes of man never saw before; and the Tailor packed them up
and marched off with them himself to the prime-minister.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 519px;">
<img src="images/i_b_177.png" width="519" height="500" alt="the demon sews while the tailor smokes a long pipe" />
</div>

<p>The prime-minister wore the clothes to court that very day, and
before evening they were the talk of the town. All the world ran to
the Tailor and ordered clothes of him, and his fortune was made.
Every day the Demon created new suits of clothes out of nothing at
all, so that the Tailor grew as rich as a Jew, and held his head up
in the world.</p>

<p>As time went along he laid heavier and heavier tasks upon the
Demon’s back, and demanded of him more and more; but all the while
the Demon kept his own counsel, and said never a word.</p>

<p>One morning, as the Tailor sat in his shop window taking the world
easy&mdash;for he had little or nothing to do now&mdash;he heard a great
hubbub in the street below, and when he looked down he saw that
it was the king’s daughter passing by. It was the first time that
the Tailor had seen her, and when he saw her his heart stood still
within him, and then began fluttering like a little bird, for one
so beautiful was not to be met with in the four corners of the
world. Then she was gone.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 351px;">
<img src="images/i_b_179.png" width="351" height="500" alt="the princess carried through the streets on a palanquin" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>All that day the little Tailor could do nothing but sit and think
of the princess, and the next morning when the Demon came he was
thinking of her still.</p>

<p>“What hast thou for me to do to-day?” said the Demon, as he always
said of a morning.</p>

<p>The little Tailor was waiting for the question.</p>

<p>“I would like you,” said he, “to send to the king’s palace, and to
ask him to let me have his daughter for my wife.”</p>

<p>“Thou shalt have thy desire,” said the Demon. Thereupon he smote
his hands together like a clap of thunder, and instantly the walls
of the room clove asunder, and there came out four-and-twenty
handsome youths, clad in cloth of gold and silver. After these
four-and-twenty there came another one who was the chief of them
all, and before whom, splendid as they were, the four-and-twenty
paled like stars in daylight. “Go to the king’s palace,” said
the Demon to that one, “and deliver this message: The Tailor of
Tailors, the Master of Masters, and One Greater than a King asks
for his daughter to wife.”</p>

<p>“To hear is to obey,” said the other, and bowed his forehead to the
earth.</p>

<p>Never was there such a hubbub in the town as when those
five-and-twenty, in their clothes of silver and gold, rode through
the streets to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span> king’s palace. As they came near, the gates of
the palace flew open before them, and the king himself came out to
meet them. The leader of the five-and-twenty leaped from his horse,
and, kissing the ground before the king, delivered his message:
“The Tailor of Tailors, the Master of Masters, and One Greater than
a King asks for thy daughter to wife.”</p>

<p>When the king heard what the messenger said, he thought and
pondered a long time. At last he said, “If he who sent you is the
Master of Masters, and greater than a king, let him send me an
asking gift such as no king could send.”</p>

<p>“It shall be as you desire,” said the messenger, and thereupon the
five-and-twenty rode away as they had come, followed by crowds of
people.</p>

<p>The next morning when the Demon came the tailor was ready and
waiting for him. “What hast thou for me to do to-day?” said the
Evil One.</p>

<p>“I want,” said the tailor, “a gift to send to the king such as no
other king could send him.”</p>

<p>“Thou shalt have thy desire,” said the Demon. Thereupon he smote
his hands together, and summoned, not five-and-twenty young men,
but fifty youths, all clad in clothes more splendid than the others.</p>

<p>All of the fifty sat upon coal-black horses, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span> saddles of
silver and housings of silk and velvet embroidered with gold. In
the midst of all the five-and-seventy there rode a youth in cloth
of silver embroidered in pearls. In his hand he bore something
wrapped in a white napkin, and that was the present for the king
such as no other king could give. So said the Demon: “Take it to
the royal palace, and tell his majesty that it is from the Tailor
of Tailors, the Master of Masters, and One Greater than a King.”</p>

<p>“To hear is to obey,” said the young man, and then they all rode
away.</p>

<p>When they came to the palace the gates flew open before them, and
the king came out to meet them. The young man who bore the present
dismounted and prostrated himself in the dust, and, when the king
bade him arise, he unwrapped the napkin, and gave to the king a
goblet made of one single ruby, and filled to the brim with pieces
of gold. Moreover, the cup was of such a kind that whenever it was
emptied of its money it instantly became full again. “The Tailor of
Tailors, and Master of Masters, and One Greater than a King sends
your majesty this goblet, and bids me, his ambassador, to ask for
your daughter,” said the young man.</p>

<p>When the king saw what had been sent him he was filled with
amazement. “Surely,” said he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span> to himself, “there can be no end to
the power of one who can give such a gift as this.” Then to the
messenger, “Tell your master that he shall have my daughter for his
wife if he will build over yonder a palace such as no man ever saw
or no king ever lived in before.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">
<img src="images/i_b_183.png" width="375" height="250" alt="the young man prostrated himself in the dust before the king" />
</div>

<p>“It shall be done,” said the young man, and then they all went
away, as the others had done the day before.</p>

<p>The next morning when the Demon appeared the Tailor was ready for
him. “Build me,” said he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span> “such and such a palace in such and such
a place.”</p>

<p>And the Demon said, “It shall be done.” He smote his hands
together, and instantly there came a cloud of mist that covered and
hid the spot where the palace was to be built. Out from the cloud
there came such a banging and hammering and clapping and clattering
as the people of that town never heard before. Then when evening
had come the cloud arose, and there, where the king had pointed
out, stood a splendid palace as white as snow, with roofs and domes
of gold and silver. As the king stood looking and wondering at this
sight, there came five hundred young men riding, and one in the
midst of all who wore a golden crown on his head, and upon his body
a long robe stiff with diamonds and pearls. “We come,” said he,
“from the Tailor of Tailors, and Master of Masters, and One Greater
than a King, to ask you to let him have your daughter for his wife.”</p>

<p>“Tell him to come!” cried the king, in admiration, “for the
princess is his.”</p>

<p>The next morning when the Demon came he found the Tailor dancing
and shouting for joy. “The princess is mine!” he cried, “so make me
ready for her.”</p>

<p>“It shall be done,” said the Demon, and thereupon he began to make
the Tailor ready for his wedding. He brought him to a marble bath
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span> water, in which he washed away all that was coarse and ugly,
and from which the little man came forth as beautiful as the sun.
Then the Demon clad him in the finest linen, and covered him with
clothes such as even the emperor of India never wore. Then he smote
his hands together, and the wall of the tailor-shop opened as it
had done twice before, and there came forth forty slaves clad in
crimson, and bearing bowls full of money in their hands. After them
came two leading a horse as white as snow, with a saddle of gold
studded with diamonds and rubies and emeralds and sapphires. After
came a bodyguard of twenty warriors clad in gold armor. Then the
Tailor mounted his horse and rode away to the king’s palace, and
as he rode the slaves scattered the money amongst the crowd, who
scrambled for it and cheered the Tailor to the skies.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That night the princess and the Tailor were married, and all the
town was lit with bonfires and fireworks. The two rode away in the
midst of a great crowd of nobles and courtiers to the palace which
the Demon had built for the Tailor; and, as the princess gazed upon
him, she thought that she had never beheld so noble and handsome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span> a
man as her husband. So she and the Tailor were the happiest couple
in the world.</p>

<p>But the next morning the Demon appeared as he had appeared ever
since the Tailor had let him out of the bottle, only now he grinned
till his teeth shone and his face turned black. “What hast thou
for me to do?” said he, and at the words the Tailor’s heart began
to quake, for he remembered what was to happen to him when he
could find the Demon no more work to do&mdash;that his neck was to be
wrung&mdash;and now he began to see that he had all that he could ask
for in the world. Yes; what was there to ask for now?</p>

<p>“I have nothing more for you to do,” said he to the Demon; “you
have done all that man could ask&mdash;you may go now.”</p>

<p>“Go!” cried the Demon, “I shall not go until I have done all that
I have to do. Give me work, or I shall wring your neck.” And his
fingers began to twitch.</p>

<p>Then the Tailor began to see into what a net he had fallen. He
began to tremble like one in an ague. He turned his eyes up and
down, for he did not know where to look for aid. Suddenly, as he
looked out of the window, a thought struck him. “Maybe,” thought
he, “I can give, the Demon such a task that even he cannot do it.”
“Yes, yes!” he cried,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span> “I have thought of something for you to do.
Make me out yonder in front of my palace a lake of water a mile
long and a mile wide, and let it be lined throughout with white
marble, and filled with water as clear as crystal.”</p>

<p>“It shall be done,” said the Demon. As he spoke he spat in the air,
and instantly a thick fog arose from the earth and hid everything
from sight. Then presently from the midst of the fog there came a
great noise of chipping and hammering, of digging and delving, of
rushing and gurgling. All day the noise and the fog continued, and
then at sunset the one ceased and the other cleared away. The poor
Tailor looked out the window, and when he saw what he saw his teeth
chattered in his head, for there was a lake a mile long and a mile
broad, lined within with white marble, and filled with water as
clear as crystal, and he knew that the Demon would come the next
morning for another task to do.</p>

<p>That night he slept little or none, and when the seventh hour of
the morning came the castle began to rock and tremble, and there
stood the Demon, and his hair bristled and his eyes shone like
sparks of fire. “What hast thou for me to do?” said he, and the
poor Tailor could do nothing but look at him with a face as white
as dough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>“What hast thou for me to do?” said the Demon again, and then at
last the Tailor found his wits and his tongue from sheer terror.
“Look!” said he, “at the great mountain over yonder; remove it,
and make in its place a level plain with fields and orchards and
gardens.” And he thought to himself when he had spoken, “Surely,
even the Demon cannot do that.”</p>

<p>“It shall be done,” said the Demon, and, so saying, he stamped his
heel upon the ground. Instantly the earth began to tremble and
quake, and there came a great rumbling like the sound of thunder.
A cloud of darkness gathered in the sky, until at last all was
as black as the blackest midnight. Then came a roaring and a
cracking and a crashing, such as man never heard before. All day it
continued, until the time of the setting of the sun, when suddenly
the uproar ceased, and the darkness cleared away; and when the
Tailor looked out of the window the mountain was gone, and in its
place were fields and orchards and gardens.</p>

<p>It was very beautiful to see, but when the Tailor beheld it his
knees began to smite together, and the sweat ran down his face in
streams. All that night he walked up and down and up and down, but
he could not think of one other task for the Demon to do.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 406px;">
<img src="images/i_b_189.png" width="406" height="500" alt="the demon appeared like a whirlwind to the Tailor" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>When the next morning came the Demon appeared like a whirlwind. His
face was as black as ink and smoke, and sparks of fire flew from
his nostrils.</p>

<p>“What have you for me to do?” cried he.</p>

<p>“I have nothing for you to do!” piped the poor Tailor.</p>

<p>“Nothing?” cried the Demon.</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“Then prepare to die.”</p>

<p>“Stop!” said the Tailor, falling on his knees, “let me first see my
wife.”</p>

<p>“So be it,” said the Demon, and if he had been wiser he would have
said “No.”</p>

<p>When the Tailor came to the princess, he flung himself on his face,
and began to weep and wail. The princess asked him what was the
matter, and at last, by dint of question, got the story from him,
piece by piece. When she had it all she began laughing. “Why did
you not come to me before?” said she, “instead of making all this
trouble and uproar for nothing at all? I will give the Monster
a task to do.” She plucked a single curling hair from her head.
“Here,” said she, “let him take this hair and make it straight.”</p>

<p>The Tailor was full of doubt; nevertheless, as there was nothing
better to do, he took it to the Demon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hast thou found me a task to do?” cried the Demon.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Tailor. “It is only a little thing. Here is a hair
from my wife’s head; take it and make it straight.”</p>

<p>When the Demon heard what was the task that the Tailor had set him
to do he laughed aloud; but that was because he did not know. He
took the hair and stroked it between his thumb and finger, and,
when he had done, it curled more than ever. Then he looked serious,
and slapped it between his palms, and that did not better matters,
for it curled as much as ever. Then he frowned, and, began beating
the hair with his palm upon his knees, and that only made it worse.
All that day he labored and strove at his task trying to make that
one little hair straight, and, when the sun set, there was the
hair just as crooked as ever. Then, as the great round sun sank
red behind the trees, the Demon knew that he was beaten. “I am
conquered! I am conquered!” he howled, and flew away, bellowing so
dreadfully that all the world trembled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>For, to my mind, the princess&mdash;not to speak of her husband the
little Tailor&mdash;did more with a single little hair and her mother
wit than King Solomon with all his wisdom.</p>

<h2><a name="A_Piece_of_Good_Luck" id="A_Piece_of_Good_Luck"></a>A Piece <i>of</i> Good Luck.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 153px;">
<img src="images/i_b_195.png" width="153" height="500" alt="well-dressed, smiling young man holding up a coin" />
</div>


<p>There were three students who were learning all that they could.
The first was named Joseph, the second was named John, and the
third was named Jacob Stuck. They studied seven long years under a
wise master, and in that time they learned all that their master
had to teach them of the wonderful things he knew. They learned
all about geometry, they learned all about algebra, they learned
all about astronomy, they learned all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span> about the hidden arts, they
learned all about everything, except how to mend their own hose and
where to get cabbage to boil in the pot.</p>

<p>And now they were to go out into the world to practise what they
knew. The master called the three students to him&mdash;the one named
Joseph, the second named John, and the third named Jacob Stuck&mdash;and
said he to them, said he: “You have studied faithfully and have
learned all that I have been able to teach you, and now you shall
not go out into the world with nothing at all. See; here are three
glass balls, and that is one for each of you. Their like is not to
be found in the four corners of the world. Carry the balls wherever
you go, and when one of them drops to the ground, dig, and there
you will certainly find a treasure.”</p>

<p>So the three students went out into the wide world.</p>

<p>Well, they travelled on and on for day after day, each carrying his
glass ball with him wherever he went. They travelled on and on for
I cannot tell how long, until one day the ball that Joseph carried
slipped out of his fingers and fell to the ground. “I’ve found a
treasure!” cried Joseph, “I’ve found a treasure!”</p>

<p>The three students fell to work scratching and digging where the
ball had fallen, and by-and-by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span> they found something. It was a
chest with an iron ring in the lid. It took all three of them to
haul it up out of the ground, and when they did so they found it
was full to the brim of silver money.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 289px;">
<img src="images/i_b_197.png" width="289" height="500" alt="the three students danced around the chest of gold" />
</div>

<p>Were they happy? Well, they were happy! They danced around and
around the chest, for they had never seen so much money in all
their lives before. “Brothers,” said Joseph, in exultation, “here
is enough for all hands, and it shall be share and share alike with
us, for haven’t we studied seven long years together?” And so for a
while they were as happy as happy could be.</p>

<p>But by-and-by a flock of second thoughts began to buzz in the heads
of John and Jacob Stuck. “Why,” said they, “as for that, to be
sure, a chest of silver money is a great thing for three students
to find who had nothing better than book-learning to help them
along; but who knows but that there is something better even than
silver money out in the wide world?” So, after all, and in spite of
the chest of silver money they had found, the two of them were for
going on to try their fortunes a little farther. And as for Joseph,
why, after all, when he came to think of it, he was not sorry to
have his chest of silver money all to himself.</p>

<p>So the two travelled on and on for a while,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span> here and there and
everywhere, until at last it was John’s ball that slipped out of
his fingers and fell to the ground. They digged where it fell, and
this time it was a chest of gold money they found.</p>

<p>Yes; a chest of gold money! A chest of real gold money! They just
stood and stared and stared, for if they had not seen it they
would not have believed that such a thing could have been in the
world. “Well, Jacob Stuck,” said John, “it was well to travel a bit
farther than poor Joseph did, was it not? What is a chest of silver
money to such a treasure as this? Come, brother, here is enough to
make us both rich for all the rest of our lives. We need look for
nothing better than this.”</p>

<p>But no; by-and-by Jacob Stuck began to cool down again, and now
that second thoughts were coming to him he would not even be
satisfied with a half-share of a chest of gold money. No; maybe
there might be something better than even a chest full of gold
money to be found in the world. As for John, why, after all, he was
just as well satisfied to keep his treasure for himself. So the two
shook hands, and then Jacob Stuck jogged away alone, leaving John
stuffing his pockets and his hat full of gold money, and I should
have liked to have been there, to have had my share.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, Jacob Stuck jogged on and on by himself, until after a while
he came to a great, wide desert, where there was not a blade or a
stick to be seen far or near. He jogged on and on, and he wished he
had not come there. He jogged on and on when all of a sudden the
glass ball he carried slipped out of his fingers and fell to the
ground.</p>

<p>“Aha!” said he to himself, “now maybe I shall find some great
treasure compared to which even silver and gold are as nothing at
all.”</p>

<p>He digged down into the barren earth of the desert; and he digged
and he digged, but neither silver nor gold did he find. He digged
and digged; and by-and-by, at last, he did find something. And
what was it? Why, nothing but something that looked like a piece
of blue glass not a bit bigger than my thumb. “Is that all?” said
Jacob Stuck. “And have I travelled all this weary way and into the
blinding desert only for this? Have I passed by silver and gold
enough to make me rich for all my life, only to find a little piece
of blue glass?”</p>

<p>Jacob Stuck did not know what he had found. I shall tell you what
it was. It was a solid piece of good luck without flaw or blemish,
and it was almost the only piece I ever heard tell of. Yes; that
was what it was&mdash;a solid piece of good luck;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span> and as for Jacob
Stuck, why, he was not the first in the world by many and one over
who has failed to know a piece of good luck when they have found
it. Yes; it looked just like a piece of blue glass no bigger than
my thumb, and nothing else.</p>

<p>“Is that all?” said Jacob Stuck. “And have I travelled all this
weary way and into the blinding desert only for this? Have I passed
by silver and gold enough to make me rich for all my life, only to
find a little piece of blue glass?”</p>

<p>He looked at the bit of glass, and he turned it over and over in
his hand. It was covered with dirt. Jacob Stuck blew his breath
upon it, and rubbed it with his thumb.</p>

<p>Crack! dong! bang! smash!</p>

<p>Upon my word, had a bolt of lightning burst at Jacob Stuck’s feet
he could not have been more struck of a heap. For no sooner had he
rubbed the glass with his thumb than with a noise like a clap of
thunder there instantly stood before him a great, big man, dressed
in clothes as red as a flame, and with eyes that shone sparks of
fire. It was the Genie of Good Luck. It nearly knocked Jacob Stuck
off his feet to see him there so suddenly.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 297px;">
<img src="images/i_b_201.png" width="297" height="500" alt="The Genie of Good Luck surprises Jacob Stuck" />
</div>

<p>“What will you have?” said the Genie.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span> “I am the slave of good luck.
Whosoever holds that piece of crystal in his hand him must I obey
in whatsoever he may command.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that you are my servant and that I am your master?”
said Jacob Stuck.</p>

<p>“Yes; command and I obey.”</p>

<p>“Why, then,” said Jacob Stuck, “I would like you to help me out of
this desert place, if you can do so, for it is a poor spot for any
Christian soul to be.”</p>

<p>“To hear is to obey,” said the Genie, and, before Jacob Stuck knew
what had happened to him, the Genie had seized him and was flying
with him through the air swifter than the wind. On and on he flew,
and the earth seemed to slide away beneath. On and on flew the
flame-colored Genie until at last he set Jacob down in a great
meadow where there was a river. Beyond the river were the white
walls and grand houses of the king’s town.</p>

<p>“Hast thou any further commands?” said the Genie.</p>

<p>“Tell me what you can do for me?” said Jacob Stuck.</p>

<p>“I can do whatsoever thou mayest order me to do,” said the Genie.</p>

<p>“Well, then,” said Jacob Stuck,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span> “I think first of all I would like
to have plenty of money to spend.”</p>

<p>“To hear is to obey,” said the Genie, and, as he spoke, he reached
up into the air and picked out a purse from nothing at all. “Here,”
said he, “is the purse of fortune; take from it all that thou
needest and yet it will always be full. As long as thou hast it
thou shalt never be lacking riches.”</p>

<p>“I am very much obliged to you,” said Jacob Stuck. “I’ve learned
geometry and algebra and astronomy and the hidden arts, but I never
heard tell of anything like this before.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So Jacob Stuck went into the town with all the money he could
spend, and such a one is welcome anywhere. He lacked nothing that
money could buy. He bought himself a fine house; he made all the
friends he wanted, and more; he lived without a care, and with
nothing to do but to enjoy himself. That was what a bit of good
luck did for him.</p>

<p>Now the princess, the daughter of the king of that town, was the
most beautiful in all the world, but so proud and haughty that her
like was not to be found within the bounds of all the seven rivers.
So proud was she and so haughty that she would neither look upon
a young man nor allow any young man to look upon her. She was so
particular that whenever she went out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span> to take a ride a herald
was sent through the town with a trumpet ordering that every house
should be closed and that everybody should stay within doors, so
that the princess should run no risk of seeing a young man, or that
no young man by chance should see her.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 446px;">
<img src="images/i_b_205.png" width="446" height="500" alt="the herald went through the town blowing his trumpet" />
</div>

<p>One day the herald went through the town blowing his trumpet and
calling in a great, loud voice: “Close your doors! Close your
windows! Her highness, the princess, comes to ride; let no man look
upon her on pain of death!”</p>

<p>Thereupon everybody began closing their doors and windows, and, as
it was with the others, so it was with Jacob Stuck’s house; it had,
like all the rest, to be shut up as tight as a jug.</p>

<p>But Jacob Stuck was not satisfied with that; not he. He was for
seeing the princess, and he was bound he would do so. So he bored
a hole through the door, and when the princess came riding by he
peeped out at her.</p>

<p>Jacob Stuck thought he had never seen anyone so beautiful in all
his life. It was like the sunlight shining in his eyes, and he
almost sneezed. Her cheeks were like milk and rose-leaves, and her
hair like fine threads of gold. She sat in a golden coach with
a golden crown upon her head, and Jacob Stuck stood looking and
looking until his heart melted within him like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span> wax in the oven.
Then the princess was gone, and Jacob Stuck stood there sighing and
sighing.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! dear!” said he, “what shall I do? For, proud as she is,
I must see her again or else I will die of it.”</p>

<p>All that day he sat sighing and thinking about the beautiful
princess, until the evening had come. Then he suddenly thought of
his piece of good luck. He pulled his piece of blue glass out of
his pocket and breathed upon it and rubbed it with his thumb, and
instantly the Genie was there.</p>

<p>This time Jacob Stuck was not frightened at all.</p>

<p>“What are thy commands, O master?” said the Genie.</p>

<p>“O Genie!” said Jacob Stuck, “I have seen the princess to-day, and
it seems to me that there is nobody like her in all the world. Tell
me, could you bring her here so that I might see her again?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Genie, “I could.”</p>

<p>“Then do so,” said Jacob Stuck, “and I will have you prepare a
grand feast, and have musicians to play beautiful music, for I
would have the princess sup with me.”</p>

<p>“To hear is to obey,” said the Genie. As he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span> spoke he smote his
hands together, and instantly there appeared twenty musicians,
dressed in cloth of gold and silver. With them they brought
hautboys and fiddles, big and little, and flageolets and drums and
horns, and this and that to make music with. Again the Genie smote
his hands together, and instantly there appeared fifty servants
dressed in silks and satins and spangled with jewels, who began
to spread a table with fine linen embroidered with gold, and to
set plates of gold and silver upon it. The Genie smote his hands
together a third time, and in answer there came six servants. They
led Jacob Stuck into another room, where there was a bath of musk
and rose-water. They bathed him in the bath and dressed him in
clothes like an emperor, and when he came out again his face shone,
and he was as handsome as a picture.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_b_209.png" width="600" height="373" alt="the Genie flew the princess through the air" />
</div>

<p>Then by-and-by he knew that the princess was coming, for suddenly
there was the sound of girls’ voices singing and the twanging of
stringed instruments. The door flew open, and in came a crowd of
beautiful girls, singing and playing music, and after them the
princess herself, more beautiful than ever. But the proud princess
was frightened! Yes, she was. And well she might be, for the Genie
had flown with her through the air from the palace, and that is
enough to frighten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span> anybody. Jacob Stuck came to her all glittering
and shining with jewels and gold, and took her by the hand. He led
her up the hall, and as he did so the musicians struck up and began
playing the most beautiful music in the world. Then Jacob Stuck and
the princess sat down to supper and began eating and drinking, and
Jacob Stuck talked of all the sweetest things he could think of.
Thousands of wax candles made the palace bright as day, and as the
princess looked about her she thought she had never seen anything
so fine in all the world. After they had eaten their supper and
ended with a dessert of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span> all kinds of fruits and of sweetmeats, the
door opened and there came a beautiful young serving-lad, carrying
a silver tray, upon which was something wrapped in a napkin. He
kneeled before Jacob Stuck and held the tray, and from the napkin
Jacob Stuck took a necklace of diamonds, each stone as big as a
pigeon’s egg.</p>

<p>“This is to remind you of me,” said Jacob Stuck, “when you have
gone home again.” And as he spoke he hung it around the princess’s
neck.</p>

<p>Just then the clock struck twelve.</p>

<p>Hardly had the last stroke sounded when every light was snuffed
out, and all was instantly dark and still. Then, before she had
time to think, the Genie of Good Luck snatched the princess up once
more and flew back to the palace more swiftly than the wind. And,
before the princess knew what had happened to her, there she was.</p>

<p>It was all so strange that the princess might have thought it was a
dream, only for the necklace of diamonds, the like of which was not
to be found in all the world.</p>

<p>The next morning there was a great buzzing in the palace, you may
be sure. The princess told all about how she had been carried away
during the night, and had supped in such a splendid palace, and
with such a handsome man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span> dressed like an emperor. She showed her
necklace of diamonds, and the king and his prime-minister could not
look at it or wonder at it enough. The prime-minister and the king
talked and talked the matter over together, and every now and then
the proud princess put in a word of her own.</p>

<p>“Anybody,” said the prime-minister, “can see with half an eye that
it is all magic, or else it is a wonderful piece of good luck. Now,
I’ll tell you what shall be done,” said he: “the princess shall
keep a piece of chalk by her; and, if she is carried away again in
such a fashion, she shall mark a cross with the piece of chalk on
the door of the house to which she is taken. Then we shall find the
rogue that is playing such a trick, and that quickly enough.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the king; “that is very good advice.”</p>

<p>“I will do it,” said the princess.</p>

<p>All that day Jacob Stuck sat thinking and thinking about the
beautiful princess. He could not eat a bite, and he could hardly
wait for the night to come. As soon as it had fallen, he breathed
upon his piece of glass and rubbed his thumb upon it, and there
stood the Genie of Good Luck.</p>

<p>“I’d like the princess here again,” said he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span> “as she was last
night, with feasting and drinking, such as we had before.”</p>

<p>“To hear is to obey,” said the Genie.</p>

<p>And as it had been the night before, so it was now. The Genie
brought the princess, and she and Jacob Stuck feasted together
until nearly midnight. Then, again, the door opened, and the
beautiful servant-lad came with the tray and something upon it
covered with a napkin. Jacob Stuck unfolded the napkin, and this
time it was a cup made of a single ruby, and filled to the brim
with gold money. And the wonder of the cup was this: that no matter
how much money you took out of it, it was always full. “Take this,”
said Jacob Stuck, “to remind you of me.” Then the clock struck
twelve, and instantly all was darkness, and the Genie carried the
princess home again.</p>

<p>But the princess had brought her piece of chalk with her, as the
prime-minister had advised; and in some way or other she contrived,
either in coming or going, to mark a cross upon the door of Jacob
Stuck’s house.</p>

<p>But, clever as she was, the Genie of Good Luck was more clever
still. He saw what the princess did; and, as soon as he had
carried her home, he went all through the town and marked a cross
upon every door, great and small, little and big,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span> just as the
princess had done upon the door of Jacob Stuck’s house, only upon
the prime-minister’s door he put two crosses. The next morning
everybody was wondering what all the crosses on the house-doors
meant, and the king and the prime-minister were no wiser than they
had been before.</p>

<p>But the princess had brought her ruby cup with her, and she and the
king could not look at it and wonder at it enough.</p>

<p>“Pooh!” said the prime-minister; “I tell you it is nothing else in
the world but just a piece of good luck&mdash;that is all it is. As for
the rogue who is playing all these tricks, let the princess keep a
pair of scissors by her, and, if she is carried away again, let her
contrive to cut off a lock of his hair from over the young man’s
right ear. Then to-morrow we will find out who has been trimmed.”</p>

<p>Yes, the princess would do that; so, before evening was come, she
tied a pair of scissors to her belt.</p>

<p>Well, Jacob Stuck could hardly wait for the night to come to summon
the Genie of Good Luck. “I want to sup with the princess again,”
said he.</p>

<p>“To hear is to obey,” said the Genie of Good Luck; and, as soon as
he had made everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span> ready, away he flew to fetch the princess
again.</p>

<p>Well, they feasted and drank, and the music played, and the candles
were as bright as day, and beautiful girls sang and danced, and
Jacob Stuck was as happy as a king. But the princess kept her
scissors by her, and, when Jacob Stuck was not looking, she
contrived to snip off a lock of his hair from over his right ear,
and nobody saw what was done but the Genie of Good Luck.</p>

<p>So it came towards midnight.</p>

<p>Once more the door opened, and the beautiful serving-lad came
into the room, carrying the tray of silver with something upon it
wrapped in a napkin. This time Jacob Stuck gave the princess an
emerald ring for a keepsake, and the wonder of it was that every
morning two other rings just like it would drop from it.</p>

<p>Then twelve o’clock sounded, the lights went out, and the Genie
took the princess home again.</p>

<p>But the Genie had seen what the princess had done. As soon as he
had taken her safe home, he struck his palms together and summoned
all his companions. “Go,” said he, “throughout the town and trim
a lock of hair from over the right ear of every man in the whole
place;” and so they did, from the king himself to the beggar-man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>at the gates. As for the prime-minister, the Genie himself trimmed
two locks of hair from him, one from over each of his ears, so that
the next morning he looked as shorn as an old sheep. In the morning
all the town was in a hubbub, and everybody was wondering how all
the men came to have their hair clipped as it was. But the princess
had brought the lock of Jacob Stuck’s hair away with her wrapped up
in a piece of paper, and there it was.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 334px;">
<img src="images/i_b_215.png" width="334" height="500" alt="the prime-minister looked as shorn as an old sheep" />
</div>

<p>As for the ring Jacob Stuck had given to her, why, the next morning
there were three of them, and the king thought he had never heard
tell of such a wonderful thing.</p>

<p>“I tell you,” said the prime-minister, “there is nothing in it but
a piece of good luck, and not a grain of virtue. It’s just a piece
of good luck&mdash;that’s all it is.”</p>

<p>“No matter,” said the king; “I never saw the like of it in all my
life before. And now, what are we going to do?”</p>

<p>The prime-minister could think of nothing.</p>

<p>Then the princess spoke up. “Your majesty,” she said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span> “I can find
the young man for you. Just let the herald go through the town and
proclaim that I will marry the young man to whom this lock of hair
belongs, and then we will find him quickly enough.”</p>

<p>“What!” cried the prime-minister; “will, then, the princess marry a
man who has nothing better than a little bit of good luck to help
him along in the world?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the princess, “I shall if I can find him.”</p>

<p>So the herald was sent out around the town proclaiming that the
princess would marry the man to whose head belonged the lock of
hair that she had.</p>

<p>A lock of hair! Why, every man had lost a lock of hair! Maybe the
princess could fit it on again, and then the fortune of him to whom
it belonged would be made. All the men in the town crowded up to
the king’s palace. But all for no use, for never a one of them was
fitted with his own hair.</p>

<p>As for Jacob Stuck, he too had heard what the herald had
proclaimed. Yes; he too had heard it, and his heart jumped and
hopped within him like a young lamb in the spring-time. He knew
whose hair it was the princess had. Away he went by himself, and
rubbed up his piece of blue glass, and there stood the Genie.</p>

<p>“What are thy commands?” said he.</p>

<p>“I am,” said Jacob Stuck,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span> “going up to the king’s palace to marry
the princess, and I would have a proper escort.”</p>

<p>“To hear is to obey,” said the Genie.</p>

<p>He smote his hands together, and instantly there appeared a score
of attendants who took Jacob Stuck, and led him into another room,
and began clothing him in a suit so magnificent that it dazzled the
eyes to look at it. He smote his hands together again, and out in
the court-yard there appeared a troop of horsemen to escort Jacob
Stuck to the palace, and they were all clad in gold-and-silver
armor. He smote his hands together again, and there appeared
twenty-and-one horses&mdash;twenty as black as night and one as white as
milk, and it twinkled and sparkled all over with gold and jewels,
and at the head of each horse of the one-and-twenty horses stood a
slave clad in crimson velvet to hold the bridle. Again he smote his
hands together, and there appeared in the ante-room twenty handsome
young men, each with a marble bowl filled with gold money, and when
Jacob Stuck came out dressed in his fine clothes there they all
were.</p>

<p>Jacob Stuck mounted upon the horse as white as milk, the young men
mounted each upon one of the black horses, the troopers in the
gold-and-silver armor wheeled their horses, the trumpets blew, and
away they rode&mdash;such a sight as was never seen in that town before,
when they had come out into the streets. The young men with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span> the
basins scattered the gold money to the people, and a great crowd
ran scrambling after, and shouted and cheered.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 284px;">
<img src="images/i_b_219.png" width="284" height="500" alt="Jacob Stuck in his finery" />
</div>

<p>So Jacob Stuck rode up to the king’s palace, and the king himself
came out to meet him with the princess hanging on his arm.</p>

<p>As for the princess, she knew him the moment she laid eyes on him.
She came down the steps, and set the lock of hair against his head,
where she had trimmed it off the night before, and it fitted and
matched exactly. “This is the young man,” said she, “and I will
marry him, and none other.”</p>

<p>But the prime-minister whispered and whispered in the king’s ear:
“I tell you this young man is nobody at all,” said he, “but just
some fellow who has had a little bit of good luck.”</p>

<p>“Pooh!” said the king, “stuff and nonsense! Just look at all the
gold and jewels and horses and men. What will you do,” said he to
Jacob Stuck, “if I let you marry the princess?”</p>

<p>“I will,” said Jacob Stuck, “build for her the finest palace that
ever was seen in all this world.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the king, “yonder are those sand hills over
there. You shall remove them and build your palace there. When it
is finished you shall marry the princess.” For if he does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span> that,
thought the king to himself, it is something better than mere good
luck.</p>

<p>“It shall,” said Jacob Stuck, “be done by to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>Well, all that day Jacob Stuck feasted and made merry at the king’s
palace, and the king wondered when he was going to begin to build
his palace. But Jacob Stuck said nothing at all; he just feasted
and drank and made merry. When night had come, however, it was all
different. Away he went by himself, and blew his breath upon his
piece of blue glass, and rubbed it with his thumb. Instantly there
stood the Genie before him. “What wouldst thou have?” said he.</p>

<p>“I would like,” said Jacob Stuck, “to have the sand hills over
yonder carried away, and a palace built there of white marble and
gold and silver, such as the world never saw before. And let there
be gardens planted there with flowering plants and trees, and let
there be fountains and marble walks. And let there be servants and
attendants in the palace of all sorts and kinds&mdash;men and women. And
let there be a splendid feast spread for to-morrow morning, for
then I am going to marry the princess.”</p>

<p>“To hear is to obey,” said the Genie, and instantly he was gone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>All night there was from the sand hills a ceaseless sound as of
thunder&mdash;a sound of banging and clapping and hammering and sawing
and calling and shouting. All that night the sounds continued
unceasingly, but at daybreak all was still, and when the sun arose
there stood the most splendid palace it ever looked down upon;
shining as white as snow, and blazing with gold and silver. All
around it were gardens and fountains and orchards. A great highway
had been built between it and the king’s palace, and all along the
highway a carpet of cloth of gold had been spread for the princess
to walk upon.</p>

<p>Dear! dear! how all the town stared with wonder when they saw such
a splendid palace standing where the day before had been nothing
but naked sand hills! The folk flocked in crowds to see it, and all
the country about was alive with people coming and going. As for
the king, he could not believe his eyes when he saw it. He stood
with the princess and looked and looked. Then came Jacob Stuck.
“And now,” said he, “am I to marry the princess?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” cried the king in admiration, “you are!”</p>

<p>So Jacob Stuck married the princess, and a splendid wedding it was.
That was what a little bit of good luck did for him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 345px;">
<img src="images/i_b_223.png" width="345" height="500" alt="Jacob bows to the king and the princess" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>After the wedding was over, it was time to go home to the grand
new palace. Then there came a great troop of horsemen with shining
armor and with music, sent by the Genie to escort Jacob Stuck and
the princess and the king and the prime-minister to Jacob Stuck’s
new palace. They rode along over the carpet of gold, and such a
fine sight was never seen in that land before. As they drew near to
the palace a great crowd of servants, clad in silks and satins and
jewels, came out to meet them, singing and dancing and playing on
harps and lutes. The king and the princess thought that they must
be dreaming.</p>

<p>“All this is yours,” said Jacob Stuck to the princess; and he was
that fond of her, he would have given her still more if he could
have thought of anything else.</p>

<p>Jacob Stuck and the princess, and the king and the prime-minister,
all went into the palace, and there was a splendid feast spread in
plates of pure gold and silver, and they all four sat down together.</p>

<p>But the prime-minister was as sour about it all as a crab-apple.
All the time they were feasting he kept whispering and whispering
in the king’s ear. “It is all stuff and nonsense,” said he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span> “for
such a man as Jacob Stuck to do all this by himself. I tell you,
it is all a piece of good luck, and not a bit of merit in it.”</p>

<p>He whispered and whispered, until at last the king up and spoke.
“Tell me, Jacob Stuck,” he said, “where do you get all these fine
things?”</p>

<p>“It all comes of a piece of good luck,” said Jacob Stuck.</p>

<p>“That is what I told you,” said the prime-minister.</p>

<p>“A piece of good luck!” said the king. “Where did you come across
such a piece of good luck?”</p>

<p>“I found it,” said Jacob Stuck.</p>

<p>“Found it!” said the king; “and have you got it with you now?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have,” said Jacob Stuck; “I always carry it about with me;”
and he thrust his hand into his pocket and brought out his piece of
blue crystal.</p>

<p>“That!” said the king. “Why, that is nothing but a piece of blue
glass!”</p>

<p>“That,” said Jacob Stuck, “is just what I thought till I found out
better. It is no common piece of glass, I can tell you. You just
breathe upon it so, and rub your thumb upon it thus, and instantly
a Genie dressed in red comes to do all that he is bidden. That is
how it is.”</p>

<p>“I should like to see it,” said the king.</p>

<p>“So you shall,” said Jacob Stuck;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span> “here it is,” said he; and he
reached it across the table to the prime-minister to give it to the
king.</p>

<p>Yes, that was what he did; he gave it to the prime-minister to give
it to the king. The prime-minister had been listening to all that
had been said, and he knew what he was about. He took what Jacob
Stuck gave him, and he had never had such a piece of luck come to
him before.</p>

<p>And did the prime-minister give it to the king, as Jacob Stuck had
intended? Not a bit of it. No sooner had he got it safe in his
hand, than he blew his breath upon it and rubbed it with his thumb.</p>

<p>Crack! dong! boom! crash!</p>

<p>There stood the Genie, like a flash and as red as fire. The
princess screamed out and nearly fainted at the sight, and the poor
king sat trembling like a rabbit.</p>

<p>“Whosoever possesses that piece of blue crystal,” said the Genie,
in a terrible voice, “him must I obey. What are thy commands?”</p>

<p>“Take this king,” cried the prime-minister, “and take Jacob Stuck,
and carry them both away into the farthest part of the desert
whence the fellow came.”</p>

<p>“To hear is to obey,” said the Genie; and instantly he seized the
king in one hand and Jacob Stuck in the other, and flew away with
them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span> swifter than the wind. On and on he flew, and the earth
seemed to slide away beneath them like a cloud. On and on he flew
until he had come to the farthest part of the desert. There he sat
them both down, and it was as pretty a pickle as ever the king or
Jacob Stuck had been in, in all of their lives. Then the Genie flew
back again whence he had come.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 489px;">
<img src="images/i_b_227.png" width="489" height="500" alt="Jacob and the king in the farthest part of the desert" />
</div>

<p>There sat the poor princess crying and crying, and there sat the
prime-minister trying to comfort her. “Why do you cry?” said he;
“why are you afraid of me? I will do you no harm. Listen,” said he;
“I will use this piece of good luck in a way that Jacob Stuck would
never have thought of. I will make myself king. I will, by means of
it, summon a great army. I will conquer the world, and make myself
emperor over all the earth. Then I will make you my queen.”</p>

<p>But the poor princess cried and cried.</p>

<p>“Hast thou any further commands?” said the Genie.</p>

<p>“Not now,” said the prime-minister; “you may go now;” and the Genie
vanished like a puff of smoke.</p>

<p>But the princess cried and cried.</p>

<p>The prime-minister sat down beside her. “Why do you cry?” said he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>“Because I am afraid of you,” said she.</p>

<p>“And why are you afraid of me?” said he.</p>

<p>“Because of that piece of blue glass. You will rub it again, and
then that great red monster will come again to frighten me.”</p>

<p>“I will rub it no more,” said he.</p>

<p>“Oh, but you will,” said she; “I know you will.”</p>

<p>“I will not,” said he.</p>

<p>“But I can’t trust you,” said she “as long as you hold it in your
hand.”</p>

<p>“Then I will lay it aside,” said he, and so he did. Yes, he did;
and he is not the first man who has thrown aside a piece of good
luck for the sake of a pretty face. “Now are you afraid of me?”
said he.</p>

<p>“No, I am not,” said she; and she reached out her hand as though to
give it to him. But, instead of doing so, she snatched up the piece
of blue glass as quick as a flash.</p>

<p>“Now,” said she, “it is my turn;” and then the prime-minister knew
that his end had come.</p>

<p>She blew her breath upon the piece of blue glass and rubbed her
thumb upon it. Instantly, as with a clap of thunder, the great red
Genie stood before her, and the poor prime-minister sat shaking and
trembling.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>
<p>“Whosoever hath that piece of blue crystal,” said the Genie, “that
one must I obey. What are your orders, O princess?”</p>

<p>“Take this man,” cried the princess, “and carry him away into the
desert where you took those other two, and bring my father and
Jacob Stuck back again.”</p>

<p>“To hear is to obey,” said the Genie, and instantly he seized
the prime-minister, and, in spite of the poor man’s kicks and
struggles, snatched him up and flew away with him swifter than the
wind. On and on he flew until he had come to the farthest part of
the desert, and there sat the king and Jacob Stuck still thinking
about things. Down he dropped the prime-minister, up he picked
the king and Jacob Stuck, and away he flew swifter than the wind.
On and on he flew until he had brought the two back to the palace
again; and there sat the princess waiting for them, with the piece
of blue crystal in her hand.</p>

<p>“You have saved us!” cried the king.</p>

<p>“You have saved us!” cried Jacob Stuck. “Yes, you have saved us,
and you have my piece of good luck into the bargain. Give it to me
again.”</p>

<p>“I will do nothing of the sort,” said the princess. “If the men
folk think no more of a piece of good luck than to hand it round
like a bit of broken glass, it is better for the women folk to keep
it for them.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>And there, to my mind, she brewed good common-sense, that needed no
skimming to make it fit for Jacob Stuck, or for any other man, for
the matter of that.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And now for the end of this story. Jacob Stuck lived with his
princess in his fine palace as grand as a king, and when the old
king died he became the king after him.</p>

<p>One day there came two men travelling along, and they were footsore
and weary. They stopped at Jacob Stuck’s palace and asked for
something to eat. Jacob Stuck did not know them at first, and then
he did. One was Joseph and the other was John.</p>

<p>This is what had happened to them:</p>

<p>Joseph had sat and sat where John and Jacob Stuck had left him on
his box of silver money, until a band of thieves had come along and
robbed him of it all. John had carried away his pockets and his hat
full of gold, and had lived like a prince as long as it had lasted.
Then he had gone back for more, but in the meantime some rogue had
come along and had stolen it all. Yes; that was what had happened,
and now they were as poor as ever.</p>

<p>Jacob Stuck welcomed them and brought them in and made much of
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, the truth is truth, and this is it: It is better to have a
little bit of good luck to help one in what one undertakes than to
have a chest of silver or a chest of gold.</p>

<p>“<i>And now for your story, holy knight,” said Fortunatus to St.
George; “for ’twas your turn, only for this fair lady who came in
before you.”</i></p>

<p><i>“Aye, aye,” said the saint; “I suppose it was, in sooth, my turn.
Ne’th’less, it gives me joy to follow so close so fair and lovely
a lady.” And as he spoke he winked one eye at Cinderella, beckoned
towards her with his cup of ale, and took a deep draught to her
health. “I shall tell you,” said he, as soon as he had caught his
breath again, “a story about an angel and a poor man who travelled
with him, and all the wonderful things the poor man saw the angel
do.”</i></p>

<p><i>“That,” said the Blacksmith who made Death sit in his pear-tree
until the wind whistled through his ribs&mdash;“that, methinks, is a
better thing to tell for a sermon than for a story.”</i></p>

<p><i>“Whether or no that be so,” said St. George, “you shall presently
hear for yourselves.”</i></p>

<p><i>He took another deep draught of ale, and then cleared his throat.</i></p>

<p><i>“Stop a bit, my friend,” said Ali Baba. “What is your story
about?”</i></p>

<h2><a name="The_Fruit_of_Happiness" id="The_Fruit_of_Happiness"></a>The Fruit of Happiness.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 155px;">

</div>

<p>Once upon a time there was a servant who served a wise man, and
cooked for him his cabbage and his onions and his pot-herbs and his
broth, day after day, time in and time out, for seven years.</p>

<p>In those years the servant was well enough contented, but no one
likes to abide in the same place forever, and so one day he took it
into his head that he would like to go out into the world to see
what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span> kind of a fortune a man might make there for himself. “Very
well,” says the wise man, the servant’s master; “you have served me
faithfully these seven years gone, and now that you ask leave to go
you shall go. But it is little or nothing in the way of money that
I can give you, and so you will have to be content with what I can
afford. See, here is a little pebble, and its like is not to be
found in the seven kingdoms, for whoever holds it in his mouth can
hear while he does so all that the birds and the beasts say to one
another. Take it&mdash;it is yours, and, if you use it wisely, it may
bring you a fortune.”</p>

<p>The servant would rather have had the money in hand than the magic
pebble, but, as nothing better was to be had, he took the little
stone, and, bidding his master good-bye, trudged out into the world
to seek his fortune. Well, he jogged on and on, paying his way with
the few pennies he had saved in his seven years of service, but for
all of his travelling nothing of good happened to him until, one
morning, he came to a lonely place where there stood a gallows, and
there he sat him down to rest, and it is just in such an unlikely
place as this that a man’s best chance of fortune comes to him
sometimes.</p>

<p>As the servant sat there, there came two ravens flying, and lit
upon the cross-beam overhead.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span> There they began talking to one
another, and the servant popped the pebble into his mouth to hear
what they might say.</p>

<p><i>“Yonder is a traveller in the world,” said the first raven.</i></p>

<p><i>“Yes,” said the second, “and if he only knew how to set about it,
his fortune is as good as made.”</i></p>

<p><i>“How is that so?” said the first raven.</i></p>

<p><i>“Why, thus,” said the second. “If he only knew enough to follow
yonder road over the hill, he would come by-and-by to a stone cross
where two roads meet, and there he would find a man sitting. If he
would ask it of him, that man would lead him to the garden where
the fruit of happiness grows.”</i></p>

<p><i>“The fruit of happiness!” said the first raven, “and of what use
would the fruit of happiness be to him?”</i></p>

<p><i>“What use? I tell you, friend, there is no fruit in the world
like that, for one has only to hold it in one’s hand and wish, and
whatever one asks for one shall have.”</i></p>

<p>You may guess that when the servant understood the talk of the
ravens he was not slow in making use of what he heard. Up he
scrambled, and away he went as fast as his legs could carry him.
On and on he travelled, until he came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span> the cross-roads and the
stone cross of which the raven spoke, and there, sure enough, sat
the traveller. He was clad in a weather-stained coat, and he wore
dusty boots, and the servant bade him good-morning.</p>

<p>How should the servant know that it was an angel whom he beheld,
and not a common wayfarer?</p>

<p>“Whither away, comrade,” asked the traveller.</p>

<p>“Out in the world,” said the servant, “to seek my fortune. And what
I want to know is this&mdash;will you guide me to where I can find the
fruit of happiness?”</p>

<p>“You ask a great thing of me,” said the other; “nevertheless, since
you do ask it, it is not for me to refuse, though I may tell you
that many a man has sought for that fruit, and few indeed have
found it. But if I guide you to the garden where the fruit grows,
there is one condition you must fulfil: many strange things will
happen upon our journey between here and there, but concerning all
you see you must ask not a question and say not a word. Do you
agree to that?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the servant, “I do.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said his new comrade; “then let us be jogging, for I
have business in the town to-night, and the time is none too long
to get there.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 388px;">
<img src="images/i_b_239.png" width="388" height="500" alt="the servant bids good-morning to the traveller at the stone cross" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>So all the rest of that day they journeyed onward together, until,
towards evening, they came to a town with high towers and steep
roofs and tall spires. The servant’s companion entered the gate as
though he knew the place right well, and led the way up one street
and down another, until, by-and-by, they came to a noble house
that stood a little apart by itself, with gardens of flowers and
fruit-trees all around it. There the travelling companion stopped,
and, drawing out a little pipe from under his jacket, began playing
so sweetly upon it that it made one’s heart stand still to listen
to the music.</p>

<p>Well, he played and played until, by-and-by, the door opened, and
out came a serving-man. “Ho, piper!” said he, “would you like to
earn good wages for your playing?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the travelling companion, “I would, for that is why I
came hither.”</p>

<p>“Then follow me,” said the servant, and thereupon the travelling
companion tucked away his pipe and entered, with the other at his
heels.</p>

<p>The house-servant led the way from one room to another, each
grander than the one they left behind, until at last he came to a
great hall where dozens of servants were serving a fine feast. But
only one man sat at table&mdash;a young man with a face so sorrowful
that it made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span> body’s heart ache to look upon him. “Can you play
good music, piper?” said he.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the piper, “that I can, for I know a tune that can cure
sorrow. But before I blow my pipe I and my friend here must have
something to eat and drink, for one cannot play well with an empty
stomach.”</p>

<p>“So be it,” said the young man; “sit down with me and eat and
drink.”</p>

<p>So the two did without second bidding, and such food and drink
the serving-man had never tasted in his life before. And while
they were feasting together the young man told them his story, and
why it was he was so sad. A year before he had married a young
lady, the most beautiful in all that kingdom, and had friends and
comrades and all things that a man could desire in the world.
But suddenly everything went wrong; his wife and he fell out and
quarrelled until there was no living together, and she had to go
back to her old home. Then his companions deserted him, and now he
lived all alone.</p>

<p>“Yours is a hard case,” said the travelling companion, “but it is
not past curing.” Thereupon he drew out his pipes and began to
play, and it was such a tune as no man ever listened to before.
He played and he played, and, after a while, one after another of
those who listened to him began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span> to get drowsy. First they winked,
then they shut their eyes, and then they nodded until all were
as dumb as logs, and as sound asleep as though they would never
waken again. Only the servant and the piper stayed awake, for the
music did not make them drowsy as it did the rest. Then, when all
but they two were tight and fast asleep, the travelling companion
arose, tucked away his pipe, and, stepping up to the young man,
took from off his finger a splendid ruby ring, as red as blood and
as bright as fire, and popped the same into his pocket. And all
the while the serving-man stood gaping like a fish to see what his
comrade was about. “Come,” said the travelling companion, “it is
time we were going,” and off they went, shutting the door behind
them.</p>

<p>As for the serving-man, though he remembered his promise and said
nothing concerning what he had beheld, his wits buzzed in his head
like a hive of bees, for he thought that of all the ugly tricks
he had seen, none was more ugly than this&mdash;to bewitch the poor
sorrowful young man into a sleep, and then to rob him of his ruby
ring after he had fed them so well and had treated them so kindly.</p>

<p>But the next day they jogged on together again until by-and-by they
came to a great forest. There they wandered up and down till night
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>came upon them and found them still stumbling onward through the
darkness, while the poor serving-man’s flesh quaked to hear the
wild beasts and the wolves growling and howling around them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

</div>

<p>But all the while the angel&mdash;his travelling companion&mdash;said never
a word; he seemed to doubt nothing nor fear nothing, but trudged
straight ahead until, by-and-by, they saw a light twinkling far
away, and, when they came to it, they found a gloomy stone house,
as ugly as eyes ever looked upon. Up stepped the servant’s comrade
and knocked upon the door&mdash;rap! tap! tap! By-and-by it was opened
a crack, and there stood an ugly old woman, blear-eyed and crooked
and gnarled as a winter twig. But the heart within her was good
for all that. “Alas, poor folk!” she cried, “why do you come here?
This is a den where lives a band of wicked thieves. Every day
they go out to rob and murder poor travellers like yourselves.
By-and-by they will come back, and when they find you here they
will certainly kill you.”</p>

<p>“No matter for that,” said the travelling companion; “we can go no
farther to-night, so you must let us in and hide us as best you
may.”</p>

<p>And in he went, as he said, with the servant at his heels trembling
like a leaf at what he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span> heard. The old woman gave them some
bread and meat to eat, and then hid them away in the great empty
meal-chest in the corner, and there they lay as still as mice.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 301px;">
<img src="images/i_b_245.png" width="301" height="250" alt="the gang of thieves" />
</div>

<p>By-and-by in came the gang of thieves with a great noise and
uproar, and down they sat to their supper. The poor servant lay in
the chest listening to all they said of the dreadful things they
had done that day&mdash;how they had cruelly robbed and murdered poor
people. Every word that they said he heard, and he trembled until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
his teeth chattered in his head. But all the same the robbers knew
nothing of the two being there, and there they lay until near the
dawning of the day. Then the travelling companion bade the servant
be stirring, and up they got, and out of the chest they came, and
found all the robbers sound asleep and snoring so that the dust
flew.</p>

<p>“Stop a bit,” said the angel&mdash;the travelling companion&mdash;“we must
pay them for our lodging.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he drew from his pocket the ruby ring which he had
stolen from the sorrowful young man’s finger, and dropped it into
the cup from which the robber captain drank. Then he led the way
out of the house, and, if the serving-man had wondered the day
before at that which his comrade did, he wondered ten times more to
see him give so beautiful a ring to such wicked and bloody thieves.</p>

<p>The third evening of their journey the two travellers came to
a little hut, neat enough, but as poor as poverty, and there
the comrade knocked upon the door and asked for lodging. In the
house lived a poor man and his wife; and, though the two were as
honest as the palm of your hand, and as good and kind as rain in
spring-time, they could hardly scrape enough of a living to keep
body and soul together. Nevertheless, they made the travellers
welcome, and set before them the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span> very best that was to be had in
the house; and, after both had eaten and drunk, they showed them to
bed in a corner as clean as snow, and there they slept the night
through.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 311px;">
<img src="images/i_b_247.png" width="311" height="500" alt="the two travellers" />
</div>

<p>But the next morning, before the dawning of the day, the travelling
companion was stirring again. “Come,” said he; “rouse yourself, for
I have a bit of work to do before I leave this place.”</p>

<p>And strange work it was! When they had come outside of the house,
he gathered together a great heap of straw and sticks of wood, and
stuffed all under the corner of the house. Then he struck a light
and set fire to it, and, as the two walked away through the gray
dawn, all was a red blaze behind them.</p>

<p>Still, the servant remembered his promise to his travelling
comrade, and said never a word or asked never a question, though
all that day he walked on the other side of the road, and would
have nothing to say or to do with the other. But never a whit did
his comrade seem to think of or to care for that. On they jogged,
and, by the time evening was at hand, they had come to a neat
cottage with apple and pear trees around it, all as pleasant as the
eye could desire to see. In this cottage lived a widow and her only
son, and they also made the travellers welcome, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span> set before
them a good supper and showed them to a clean bed.</p>

<p>This time the travelling comrade did neither good nor ill to those
of the house, but in the morning he told the widow whither they
were going, and asked if she and her son knew the way to the garden
where grew the fruit of happiness.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said she, “that we do, for the garden is not a day’s journey
from here, and my son himself shall go with you to show you the
way.”</p>

<p>“That is good,” said the servant’s comrade, “and if he will do so I
will pay him well for his trouble.”</p>

<p>So the young man put on his hat, and took up his stick, and off
went the three, up hill and down dale, until by-and-by they came
over the top of the last hill, and there below them lay the garden.</p>

<p>And what a sight it was, with the leaves shining and glistening
like so many jewels in the sunlight! I only wish that I could tell
you how beautiful that garden was. And in the middle of it grew a
golden tree, and on it golden fruit. The servant, who had travelled
so long and so far, could see it plainly from where he stood, and
he did not need to be told that it was the fruit of happiness. But,
after all, all he could do was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span> stand and look, for in front of
them was a great raging torrent, without a bridge for a body to
cross over.</p>

<p>“Yonder is what you seek,” said the young man, pointing with his
finger, “and there you can see for yourself the fruit of happiness.”</p>

<p>The travelling companion said never a word, good or bad, but,
suddenly catching the widow’s son by the collar, he lifted him and
flung him into the black, rushing water. Splash! went the young
man, and then away he went whirling over rocks and water-falls.
“There!” cried the comrade, “that is your reward for your service!”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 315px;">
<img src="images/i_b_251.png" width="315" height="500" alt="the young man went whirling over rocks and water-falls" />
</div>

<p>When the servant saw this cruel, wicked deed, he found his tongue
at last, and all that he had bottled up for the seven days came
frothing out of him like hot beer. Such abuse as he showered upon
his travelling companion no man ever listened to before. But to
all the servant said the other answered never a word until he had
stopped for sheer want of breath. Then&mdash;</p>

<p>“Poor fool,” said the travelling companion, “if you had only held
your tongue a minute longer, you, too, would have had the fruit of
happiness in your hand. Now it will be many a day before you have a
sight of it again.”</p>

<p>Thereupon, as he ended speaking, he struck his staff upon the
ground. Instantly the earth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span> trembled, and the sky darkened
overhead until it grew as black as night. Then came a great flash
of fire from up in the sky, which wrapped the travelling companion
about until he was hidden from sight. Then the flaming fire flew
away to heaven again, carrying him along with it. After that the
sky cleared once more, and, lo and behold! the garden and the
torrent and all were gone, and nothing was left but a naked plain
covered over with the bones of those who had come that way before,
seeking the fruit which the travelling servant had sought.</p>

<p>It was a long time before the servant found his way back into the
world again, and the first house he came to, weak and hungry, was
the widow’s.</p>

<p>But what a change he beheld! It was a poor cottage no longer, but a
splendid palace, fit for a queen to dwell in. The widow herself met
him at the door, and she was dressed in clothes fit for a queen to
wear, shining with gold and silver and precious stones.</p>

<p>The servant stood and stared like one bereft of wits. “How comes
all this change?” said he, “and how did you get all these grand
things?”</p>

<p>“My son,” said the widow woman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span> “has just been to the garden, and
has brought home from there the fruit of happiness. Many a day did
we search, but never could we find how to enter into the garden,
until, the other day, an angel came and showed the way to my son,
and he was able not only to gather of the fruit for himself, but to
bring an apple for me also.”</p>

<p>Then the poor travelling servant began to thump his head. He saw
well enough through the millstone now, and that he, too, might have
had one of the fruit if he had but held his tongue a little longer.</p>

<p>Yes, he saw what a fool he had made of himself, when he learned
that it was an angel with whom he had been travelling the five days
gone.</p>

<p>But, then, we are all of us like the servant for the matter of
that; I, too, have travelled with an angel many a day, I dare say,
and never knew it.</p>

<p>That night the servant lodged with the widow and her son, and the
next day he started back home again upon the way he had travelled
before. By evening he had reached the place where the house of the
poor couple stood&mdash;the house that he had seen the angel set fire
to. There he beheld masons and carpenters hard at work hacking and
hewing, and building a fine new house. And there he saw the poor
man himself standing by giving them orders. “How is this,” said
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span> travelling servant; “I thought that your house was burned
down?”</p>

<p>“So it was, and that is how I came to be rich now,” said the
one-time poor man. “I and my wife had lived in our old house for
many a long day, and never knew that a great treasure of silver
and gold was hidden beneath it, until a few days ago there came
an angel and burned it down over our heads, and in the morning we
found the treasure. So now we are rich for as long as we may live.”</p>

<p>The next morning the poor servant jogged along on his homeward
way more sad and downcast than ever, and by evening he had come
to the robbers’ den in the thick woods, and there the old woman
came running to the door to meet him. “Come in!” cried she; “come
in and welcome! The robbers are all dead and gone now, and I use
the treasure that they left behind to entertain poor travellers
like yourself. The other day there came an angel hither, and with
him he brought the ring of discord that breeds spite and rage and
quarrelling. He gave it to the captain of the band, and after he
had gone the robbers fought for it with one another until they were
all killed. So now the world is rid of them, and travellers can
come and go as they please.”</p>

<p>Back jogged the travelling servant, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span> next day came to the
town and to the house of the sorrowful young man. There, lo and
behold! instead of being dark and silent, as it was before, all
was ablaze with light and noisy with the sound of rejoicing and
merriment. There happened to be one of the household standing at
the door, and he knew the servant as the companion of that one who
had stolen the ruby ring. Up he came and laid hold of the servant
by the collar, calling to his companions that he had caught one of
the thieves. Into the house they hauled the poor servant, and into
the same room where he had been before, and there sat the young man
at a grand feast, with his wife and all his friends around him. But
when the young man saw the poor serving-man he came to him and took
him by the hand, and set him beside himself at the table. “Nobody
except your comrade could be so welcome as you,” said he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span> “and this
is why. An enemy of mine one time gave me a ruby ring, and, though
I knew nothing of it, it was the ring of discord that bred strife
wherever it came. So, as soon as it was brought into the house,
my wife and all my friends fell out with me, and we quarrelled so
that they all left me. But, though I knew it not at that time, your
comrade was an angel, and took the ring away with him, and now I am
as happy as I was sorrowful before.”</p>

<p>By the next night the servant had come back to his home again. Rap!
tap! tap! he knocked at the door, and the wise man who had been his
master opened to him. “What do you want?” said he.</p>

<p>“I want to take service with you again,” said the travelling
servant.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the wise man; “come in and shut the door.”</p>

<p>And for all I know the travelling servant is there to this day. For
he is not the only one in the world who has come in sight of the
fruit of happiness, and then jogged all the way back home again to
cook cabbage and onions and pot-herbs, and to make broth for wiser
men than himself to sup.</p>

<p>That is the end of this story.</p>

<p><i>“I like your story, holy sir,” said the Blacksmith who made Death
sit in a pear-tree. “Ne’th’less, it hath indeed somewhat the smack
of a sermon, after all. Methinks I am like my friend yonder,” and
he pointed with his thumb towards Fortunatus; “I like to hear a
story about treasures of silver and gold, and about kings and
princes&mdash;a story that turneth out well in the end, with everybody
happy, and the man himself married in luck, rather than one that
turneth out awry, even if it hath an angel in it.”</i></p>

<p><i>“Well, well,” said St. George, testily, “one cannot please
everybody. But as for being a sermon, why, certes, my story was not
that&mdash;and even if it were, it would not have hurt thee, sirrah.”</i></p>

<p><i>“No offence,” said the Blacksmith; “I meant not to speak ill of
your story. Come, come, sir, will you not take a pot of ale with
me?”</i></p>

<p><i>“Why,” said St. George, somewhat mollified, “for the matter of
that, I would as lief as not.”</i></p>

<p><i>“I liked the story well enough,” piped up the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span> Tailor who
had killed seven flies at a blow. “’Twas a good enough story of its
sort, but why does nobody tell a tale of good big giants, and of
wild boars, and of unicorns, such as I killed in my adventures you
wot of?”</i></p>

<p><i>Old Ali Baba had been sitting with his hands folded and his eyes
closed. Now he opened them and looked at the little Tailor. “I know
a story,” said he, “about a Genie who was as big as a giant, and
six times as powerful. And besides that,” he added, “the story is
all about treasures of gold, and palaces, and kings, and emperors,
and what not, and about a cave such as that in which I myself found
the treasure of the forty thieves.”</i></p>

<p><i>The Blacksmith who made Death sit in the pear-tree clattered the
bottom of his canican against the table. “Aye, aye,” said he, “that
is the sort of story for me. Come, friend, let us have it.”</i></p>

<p><i>“Stop a bit,” said Fortunatus; “what is this story mostly about?”</i></p>

<p><i>“It is,” said Ali Baba, “about two men betwixt whom there was&mdash;”</i></p>

<h2><a name="Not_a_Pin_to_Choose" id="Not_a_Pin_to_Choose"></a>Not a Pin to Choose.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_b_259.png" width="200" height="400" alt="a merchant from the far east" />
</div>

<p>Once upon a time, in a country in the far East, a merchant was
travelling towards the city with three horses loaded with rich
goods, and a purse containing a hundred pieces of gold money.
The day was very hot, and the road dusty and dry, so that,
by-and-by, when he reached a spot where a cool, clear spring of
water came bubbling out from under a rock beneath the shade of
a wide-spreading wayside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span> tree, he was glad enough to stop and
refresh himself with a draught of the clear coolness and rest
awhile. But while he stooped to drink at the fountain the purse of
gold fell from his girdle into the tall grass, and he, not seeing
it, let it lie there, and went his way.</p>

<p>Now it chanced that two fagot-makers&mdash;the elder by name Ali, the
younger Abdallah&mdash;who had been in the woods all day chopping
fagots, came also travelling the same way, and stopped at the same
fountain to drink. There the younger of the two spied the purse
lying in the grass, and picked it up. But when he opened it and
found it full of gold money, he was like one bereft of wits; he
flung his arms, he danced, he shouted, he laughed, he acted like
a madman; for never had he seen so much wealth in all of his life
before&mdash;a hundred pieces of gold money!</p>

<p>Now the older of the two was by nature a merry wag, and though he
had never had the chance to taste of pleasure, he thought that
nothing in the world could be better worth spending money for than
wine and music and dancing. So, when the evening had come, he
proposed that they two should go and squander it all at the Inn.
But the younger fellow&mdash;Abdallah&mdash;was by nature just as thrifty as
the other was spendthrift, and would not consent to waste what he
had found. Nevertheless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span> he was generous and open-hearted, and
grudged his friend nothing; so, though he did not care for a wild
life himself, he gave Ali a piece of gold to spend as he chose.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 266px;">
<img src="images/i_b_261.png" width="266" height="500" alt="the older fagot-maker dancing" />
</div>

<p>By morning every copper of what had been given to the elder
fagot-maker was gone, and he had never had such a good time in
his life before. All that day and for a week the head of Ali was
so full of the memory of the merry night that he had enjoyed that
he could think of nothing else. At last, one evening, he asked
Abdallah for another piece of gold, and Abdallah gave it to him,
and by the next morning it had vanished in the same way that the
other had flown. By-and-by Ali borrowed a third piece of money, and
then a fourth and then a fifth, so that by the time that six months
had passed and gone he had spent thirty of the hundred pieces that
had been found, and in all that time Abdallah had used not so much
as a pistareen.</p>

<p>But when Ali came for the thirty-and-first loan, Abdallah refused
to let him have any more money. It was in vain that the elder
begged and implored&mdash;the younger abided by what he had said.</p>

<p>Then Ali began to put on a threatening front. “You will not let me
have the money?” he said.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>
<p>“No, I will not.”</p>

<p>“You will not?”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“Then you shall!” cried Ali; and, so saying, caught the younger
fagot-maker by the throat, and began shaking him and shouting
“Help! Help! I am robbed! I am robbed!” He made such an uproar that
half a hundred men, women, and children were gathered around them
in less than a minute. “Here is ingratitude for you!” cried Ali.
“Here is wickedness and thievery! Look at this wretch, all good
men, and then turn away your eyes! For twelve years have I lived
with this young man as a father might live with a son, and now how
does he repay me? He has stolen all that I have in the world&mdash;a
purse of seventy sequins of gold.”</p>

<p>All this while poor Abdallah had been so amazed that he could do
nothing but stand and stare like one stricken dumb; whereupon all
the people, thinking him guilty, dragged him off to the judge,
reviling him and heaping words of abuse upon him.</p>

<p>Now the judge of that town was known far and near as the “Wise
Judge;” but never had he had such a knotty question as this brought
up before him, for by this time Abdallah had found his speech, and
swore with a great outcry that the money belonged to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>But at last a gleam of light came to the Wise Judge in his
perplexity. “Can any one tell me,” said he, “which of these fellows
has had money of late, and which has had none?”</p>

<p>His question was one easily enough answered; a score of people were
there to testify that the elder of the two had been living well
and spending money freely for six months and more, and a score
were also there to swear that Abdallah had lived all the while in
penury. “Then that decides the matter,” said the Wise Judge. “The
money belongs to the elder fagot-maker.”</p>

<p>“But listen, oh my lord judge!” cried Abdallah. “All that this man
has spent I have given to him&mdash;I, who found the money. Yes, my
lord, I have given it to him, and myself have spent not so much as
a single mite.”</p>

<p>All who were present shouted with laughter at Abdallah’s speech,
for who would believe that any one would be so generous as to spend
all upon another and none upon himself?</p>

<p>So poor Abdallah was beaten with rods until he confessed where he
had hidden his money; then the Wise Judge handed fifty sequins to
Ali and kept twenty himself for his decision, and all went their
way praising his justice and judgment.</p>

<p>That is to say, all but poor Abdallah; he went to his home weeping
and wailing, and with every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span> one pointing the finger of scorn at
him. He was just as poor as ever, and his back was sore with the
beating that he had suffered. All that night he continued to weep
and wail, and when the morning had come he was weeping and wailing
still.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 266px;">
<img src="images/i_b_265.png" width="373" height="500" alt="a wise man stops to hear Abdallah's weeping" />
</div>

<p>Now it chanced that a wise man passed that way, and, hearing his
lamentation, stopped to inquire the cause of his trouble. Abdallah
told the other of his sorrow, and the wise man listened, smiling,
till he was done, and then he laughed outright. “My son,” said
he, “if every one in your case should shed tears as abundantly as
you have done, the world would have been drowned in salt water by
this time. As for your friend, think not ill of him; no man loveth
another who is always giving.”</p>

<p>“Nay,” said the young fagot-maker, “I believe not a word of what
you say. Had I been in his place I would have been grateful for the
benefits, and not have hated the giver.”</p>

<p>But the wise man only laughed louder than ever. “Maybe you will
have the chance to prove what you say some day,” said he, and went
his way, still shaking with his merriment.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>“All this,” said Ali Baba,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span> “is only the beginning of my story;
and now if the damsel will fill up my pot of ale, I will begin in
earnest and tell about the cave of the Genie.”</i></p>

<p><i>He watched Little Brown Betty until she had filled his mug, and
the froth ran over the top. Then he took a deep draught and began
again.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Though Abdallah had affirmed that he did not believe what the wise
man had said, nevertheless the words of the other were a comfort,
for it makes one feel easier in trouble to be told that others have
been in a like case with one’s self.</p>

<p>So, by-and-by, Abdallah plucked up some spirit, and, saddling his
ass and shouldering his axe, started off to the woods for a bundle
of fagots.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Misfortunes, they say, never come singly, and so it seemed to be
with the fagot-maker that day; for that happened that had never
happened to him before&mdash;he lost his way in the woods. On he went,
deeper and deeper into the thickets, driving his ass before him,
bewailing himself and rapping his head with his knuckles. But all
his sorrowing helped him nothing, and by the time that night fell
he found himself deep in the midst of a great forest full of wild
beasts, the very thought of which curdled his blood. He had had
nothing to eat all day long, and now the only resting-place left
him was the branches of some tree. So, unsaddling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span> his ass and
leaving it to shift for itself, he climbed to and roosted himself
in the crotch of a great limb.</p>

<p>In spite of his hunger he presently fell asleep, for trouble breeds
weariness as it breeds grief.</p>

<p>About the dawning of the day he was awakened by the sound of voices
and the glaring of lights. He craned his neck and looked down, and
there he saw a sight that filled him with amazement: three old men
riding each upon a milk-white horse and each bearing a lighted
torch in his hand, to light the way through the dark forest.</p>

<p>When they had come just below where Abdallah sat, they dismounted
and fastened their several horses to as many trees. Then he who
rode first of the three, and who wore a red cap and who seemed to
be the chief of them, walked solemnly up to a great rock that stood
in the hill-side, and, breaking a switch from a shrub that grew in
a cleft, struck the face of the stone, crying in a loud voice, “I
command thee to open, in the name of the red Aldebaran!”</p>

<p>Instantly, creaking and groaning, the face of the rock opened like
a door, gaping blackly. Then, one after another, the three old men
entered, and nothing was left but the dull light of their torches,
shining on the walls of the passage-way.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 254px;">
<img src="images/i_b_269.png" width="254" height="500" alt="bales and bundles of rich stuffs pouring from the cavern" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>What happened inside the cavern the fagot-maker could neither see
nor hear, but minute after minute passed while he sat as in a maze
at all that had happened. Then presently he heard a deep thundering
voice and a voice as of one of the old men in answer. Then there
came a sound swelling louder and louder, as though a great crowd of
people were gathering together, and with the voices came the noise
of the neighing of horses and the trampling of hoofs. Then at last
there came pouring from out the rock a great crowd of horses laden
with bales and bundles of rich stuffs and chests and caskets of
gold and silver and jewels, and each horse was led by a slave clad
in a dress of cloth-of-gold, sparkling and glistening with precious
gems. When all these had come out from the cavern, other horses
followed, upon each of which sat a beautiful damsel, more lovely
than the fancy of man could picture. Beside the damsels marched
a guard, each man clad in silver armor, and each bearing a drawn
sword that flashed in the brightening day more keenly than the
lightning. So they all came pouring forth from the cavern until it
seemed as though the whole woods below were filled with the wealth
and the beauty of King Solomon’s day&mdash;and then, last of all, came
the three old men.</p>

<p>“In the name of the red Aldebaran,” said he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span> who had bidden the
rock to open, “I command thee to become closed.” Again, creaking
and groaning, the rock shut as it had opened&mdash;like a door&mdash;and the
three old men, mounting their horses, led the way from the woods,
the others following. The noise and confusion of the many voices
shouting and calling, the trample and stamp of horses, grew fainter
and fainter, until at last all was once more hushed and still, and
only the fagot-maker was left behind, still staring like one dumb
and bereft of wits.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 304px;">
<img src="images/i_b_271.png" width="304" height="500" alt="Abdallah enters the cavern" />
</div>

<p>But so soon as he was quite sure that all were really gone, he
clambered down as quickly as might be. He waited for a while to
make doubly sure that no one was left behind, and then he walked
straight up to the rock, just as he had seen the old man do. He
plucked a switch from the bush, just as he had seen the old man
pluck one, and struck the stone, just as the old man had struck
it. “I command thee to open,” said he, “in the name of the red
Aldebaran!”</p>

<p>Instantly, as it had done in answer to the old man’s command, there
came a creaking and a groaning, and the rock slowly opened like a
door, and there was the passageway yawning before him. For a moment
or two the fagot-maker hesitated to enter; but all was as still as
death, and finally he plucked up courage and went within.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>By this time the day was brightening and the sun rising, and
by the gray light the fagot-maker could see about him pretty
clearly. Not a sign was to be seen of horses or of treasure or
of people&mdash;nothing but a square block of marble, and upon it a
black casket, and upon that again a gold ring, in which was set a
blood-red stone. Beyond these things there was nothing; the walls
were bare, the roof was bare, the floor was bare&mdash;all was bare and
naked stone.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the wood-chopper, “as the old men have taken
everything else, I might as well take these things. The ring is
certainly worth something, and maybe I shall be able to sell the
casket for a trifle into the bargain.” So he slipped the ring upon
his finger, and, taking up the casket, left the place. “I command
thee to be closed,” said he, “in the name of the red Aldebaran!”
And thereupon the door closed, creaking and groaning.</p>

<p>After a little while he found his ass, saddled it and bridled it,
and loaded it with the bundle of fagots that he had chopped the day
before, and then set off again to try to find his way out of the
thick woods. But still his luck was against him, and the farther
he wandered the deeper he found himself in the thickets. In the
meantime he was like to die of hunger, for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span> had not had a bite
to eat for more than a whole day.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said he to himself, “there may be something in the
casket to stay my stomach;” and, so saying, he sat him down,
unlocked the casket, and raised the lid.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such a yell as the poor wretch uttered ears never heard before.
Over he rolled upon his back and there lay staring with wide eyes,
and away scampered the jackass, kicking up his heels and braying so
that the leaves of the trees trembled and shook. For no sooner had
he lifted the lid than out leaped a great hideous Genie, as black
as a coal, with one fiery-red eye in the middle of his forehead
that glared and rolled most horribly, and with his hands and feet
set with claws, sharp and hooked like the talons of a hawk. Poor
Abdallah the fagot-maker lay upon his back staring at the monster
with a face as white as wax.</p>

<p>“What are thy commands?” said the Genie in a terrible voice, that
rumbled like the sound of thunder.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I do not know,” said Abdallah, trembling and shaking as with an
ague. “I&mdash;I have forgotten.”</p>

<p>“Ask what thou wilt,” said the Genie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span> “for I must ever obey
whomsoever hast the ring that thou wearest upon thy finger. Hath
my lord nothing to command wherein I may serve him?”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 302px;">
<img src="images/i_b_275.png" width="302" height="500" alt="Abdallah lay on his back staring u at the hideous Genie" />
</div>

<p>Abdallah shook his head. “No,” said he, “there is
nothing&mdash;unless&mdash;unless you will bring me something to eat.”</p>

<p>“To hear is to obey,” said the Genie. “What will my lord be pleased
to have?”</p>

<p>“Just a little bread and cheese,” said Abdallah.</p>

<p>The Genie waved his hand, and in an instant a fine damask napkin
lay spread upon the ground, and upon it a loaf of bread as white as
snow and a piece of cheese such as the king would have been glad to
taste. But Abdallah could do nothing but sit staring at the Genie,
for the sight of the monster quite took away his appetite.</p>

<p>“What more can I do to serve thee?” asked the Genie.</p>

<p>“I think,” said Abdallah, “that I could eat more comfortably if you
were away.”</p>

<p>“To hear is to obey,” said the Genie. “Whither shall I go? Shall I
enter the casket again?”</p>

<p>“I do not know,” said the fagot-maker; “how did you come to be
there?”</p>

<p>“I am a great Genie,” answered the monster,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span> “and was conjured
thither by the great King Solomon, whose seal it is that thou
wearest upon thy finger. For a certain fault that I committed I
was confined in the box and hidden in the cavern where thou didst
find me to-day. There I lay for thousands of years until one day
three old magicians discovered the secret of where I lay hidden. It
was they who only this morning compelled me to give them that vast
treasure which thou sawest them take away from the cavern not long
since.”</p>

<p>“But why did they not take you and the box and the ring away also?”
asked Abdallah.</p>

<p>“Because,” answered the Genie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span> “they are three brothers, and
neither two care to trust the other one with such power as the ring
has to give, so they made a solemn compact among themselves that I
should remain in the cavern, and that no one of the three should
visit it without the other two in his company. Now, my lord, if it
is thy will that I shall enter the casket again I must even obey
thy command in that as in all things; but, if it please thee, I
would fain rejoin my own kind again&mdash;they from whom I have been
parted for so long. Shouldst thou permit me to do so I will still
be thy slave, for thou hast only to press the red stone in the ring
and repeat these words: ‘By the red Aldebaran, I command thee to
come,’ and I will be with thee instantly. But if I have my freedom
I shall serve thee from gratitude and love, and not from compulsion
and with fear.”</p>

<p>“So be it!” said Abdallah. “I have no choice in the matter, and
thou mayest go whither it pleases thee.”</p>

<p>No sooner had the words left his lips than the Genie gave a great
cry of rejoicing, so piercing that it made Abdallah’s flesh creep,
and then, fetching the black casket a kick that sent it flying over
the tree tops, vanished instantly.</p>

<p>“Well,” quoth Abdallah, when he had caught his breath from his
amazement, “these are the most wonderful things that have happened
to me in all of my life.” And thereupon he fell to at the bread and
cheese, and ate as only a hungry man can eat. When he had finished
the last crumb he wiped his mouth with the napkin, and, stretching
his arms, felt within him that he was like a new man.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he was still lost in the woods, and now not even with
his ass for comradeship.</p>

<p>He had wandered for quite a little while before he bethought
himself of the Genie. “What a fool am I,” said he, “not to have
asked him to help me while he was here.” He pressed his finger
upon the ring, and cried in a loud voice, “By the red Aldebaran, I
command thee to come!”</p>

<p>Instantly the Genie stood before him&mdash;big,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span> black, ugly, and grim.
“What are my lord’s commands?” said he.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 275px;">
<img src="images/i_b_279.png" width="275" height="500" alt="Abdallah eating his bread and cheese" />
</div>

<p>“I command thee,” said Abdallah the fagot-maker, who was not half
so frightened at the sight of the monster this time as he had been
before&mdash;“I command thee to help me out of this woods.”</p>

<p>Hardly were the words out of his mouth when the Genie snatched
Abdallah up, and, flying swifter than the lightning, set him down
in the middle of the highway on the outskirts of the forest before
he had fairly caught his breath.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When he did gather his wits and looked about him, he knew very well
where he was, and that he was upon the road that led to the city.
At the sight his heart grew light within him, and off he stepped
briskly for home again.</p>

<p>But the sun shone hot and the way was warm and dusty, and before
Abdallah had gone very far the sweat was running down his face
in streams. After a while he met a rich husbandman riding easily
along on an ambling nag, and when Abdallah saw him he rapped his
head with his knuckles. “Why did I not think to ask the Genie for
a horse?” said he.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span> “I might just as well have ridden as to have
walked, and that upon a horse a hundred times more beautiful than
the one that that fellow rides.”</p>

<p>He stepped into the thicket beside the way, where he might be out
of sight, and there pressed the stone in his ring, and at his
bidding the Genie stood before him.</p>

<p>“What are my lord’s commands?” said he.</p>

<p>“I would like to have a noble horse to ride upon,” said
Abdallah&mdash;“a horse such as a king might use.”</p>

<p>“To hear is to obey,” said the Genie; and, stretching out his hand,
there stood before Abdallah a magnificent Arab horse, with a saddle
and bridle studded with precious stones, and with housings of gold.
“Can I do aught to serve my lord further?” said the Genie.</p>

<p>“Not just now,” said Abdallah; “if I have further use for you I
will call you.”</p>

<p>The Genie bowed his head and was gone like a flash, and Abdallah
mounted his horse and rode off upon his way. But he had not gone
far before he drew rein suddenly. “How foolish must I look,” said
he, “to be thus riding along the high-road upon this noble steed,
and I myself clad in fagot-maker’s rags.” Thereupon he turned his
horse into the thicket and again summoned the Genie. “I should
like,” said he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span> “to have a suit of clothes fit for a king to wear.”</p>

<p>“My lord shall have that which he desires,” said the Genie. He
stretched out his hand, and in an instant there lay across his
arm raiment such as the eyes of man never saw before&mdash;stiff with
pearls, and blazing with diamonds and rubies and emeralds and
sapphires. The Genie himself aided Abdallah to dress, and when he
looked down he felt, for the time, quite satisfied.</p>

<p>He rode a little farther. Then suddenly he bethought himself, “What
a silly spectacle shall I cut in the town with no money in my purse
and with such fine clothes upon my back.” Once more the Genie was
summoned. “I should like,” said the fagot-maker, “to have a box
full of money.”</p>

<p>The Genie stretched out his hand, and in it was a casket of
mother-of-pearl inlaid with gold and full of money. “Has my lord
any further commands for his servant?” asked he.</p>

<p>“No,” answered Abdallah. “Stop&mdash;I have, too,” he added. “Yes; I
would like to have a young man to carry my money for me.”</p>

<p>“He is here,” said the Genie. And there stood a beautiful youth
clad in clothes of silver tissue, and holding a milk-white horse by
the bridle.</p>

<p>“Stay, Genie,” said Abdallah.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span> “Whilst thou art here thou mayest as
well give me enough at once to last me a long time to come. Let me
have eleven more caskets of money like this one, and eleven more
slaves to carry the same.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 341px;">
<img src="images/i_b_283.png" width="341" height="500" alt="the beautiful youth holding a milk-white horse by the bridle" />
</div>

<p>“They are here,” said the Genie; and as he spoke there stood eleven
more youths before Abdallah, as like the first as so many pictures
of the same person, and each youth bore in his hands a box like
the one that the monster had given Abdallah. “Will my lord have
anything further?” asked the Genie.</p>

<p>“Let me think,” said Abdallah. “Yes; I know the town well, and that
should one so rich as I ride into it without guards he would be
certain to be robbed before he had travelled a hundred paces. Let
me have an escort of a hundred armed men.”</p>

<p>“It shall be done,” said the Genie, and, waving his hand, the road
where they stood was instantly filled with armed men, with swords
and helmets gleaming and flashing in the sun, and all seated upon
magnificently caparisoned horses. “Can I serve my lord further?”
asked the Genie.</p>

<p>“No,” said Abdallah the fagot-maker, in admiration, “I have nothing
more to wish for in this world. Thou mayest go, Genie, and it will
be long ere I will have to call thee again,” and thereupon the
Genie was gone like a flash.</p>

<p>The captain of Abdallah’s troop&mdash;a bearded warrior clad in a superb
suit of armor&mdash;rode up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span> to the fagot-maker, and, leaping from his
horse and bowing before him so that his forehead touched the dust,
said, “Whither shall we ride, my lord?”</p>

<p>Abdallah smote his forehead with vexation. “If I live a thousand
years,” said he, “I will never learn wisdom.” Thereupon,
dismounting again, he pressed the ring and summoned the Genie. “I
was mistaken,” said he, “as to not wanting thee so soon. I would
have thee build me in the city a magnificent palace, such as man
never looked upon before, and let it be full from top to bottom
with rich stuffs and treasures of all sorts. And let it have
gardens and fountains and terraces fitting for such a place, and
let it be meetly served with slaves, both men and women, the most
beautiful that are to be found in all of the world.”</p>

<p>“Is there aught else that thou wouldst have?” asked the Genie.</p>

<p>The fagot-maker meditated a long time. “I can bethink myself of
nothing more just now,” said he.</p>

<p>The Genie turned to the captain of the troop and said some words to
him in a strange tongue, and then in a moment was gone. The captain
gave the order to march, and away they all rode with Abdallah in
the midst.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span> “Who would have thought,” said he, looking around him,
with the heart within him swelling with pride as though it would
burst&mdash;“who would have thought that only this morning I was a poor
fagot-maker, lost in the woods and half starved to death? Surely
there is nothing left for me to wish for in this world!”</p>

<p>Abdallah was talking of something he knew nothing of.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Never before was such a sight seen in that country, as Abdallah and
his troop rode through the gates and into the streets of the city.
But dazzling and beautiful as were those who rode attendant upon
him, Abdallah the fagot-maker surpassed them all as the moon dims
the lustre of the stars. The people crowded around shouting with
wonder, and Abdallah, in the fulness of his delight, gave orders to
the slaves who bore the caskets of money to open them and to throw
the gold to the people. So, with those in the streets scrambling
and fighting for the money and shouting and cheering, and others
gazing down at the spectacle from the windows and the house-tops,
the fagot-maker and his troop rode slowly along through the town.</p>

<p>Now it chanced that their way led along past the royal palace, and
the princess, hearing all the shouting and the hubbub, looked over
the edge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span> the balcony and down into the street. At the same
moment Abdallah chanced to look up, and their eyes met. Thereupon
the fagot-maker’s heart crumbled away within him, for she was the
most beautiful princess in all the world. Her eyes were as black as
night, her hair like threads of fine silk, her neck like alabaster,
and her lips and her cheeks as soft and as red as rose-leaves. When
she saw that Abdallah was looking at her she dropped the curtain of
the balcony and was gone, and the fagot-maker rode away, sighing
like a furnace.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 277px;">
<img src="images/i_b_287.png" width="277" height="500" alt="the princess looked over the edge of the balcony" />
</div>

<p>So, by-and-by, he came to his palace, which was built all of marble
as white as snow, and which was surrounded with gardens, shaded
by flowering trees, and cooled by the plashing of fountains. From
the gateway to the door of the palace a carpet of cloth-of-gold
had been spread for him to walk upon, and crowds of slaves stood
waiting to receive him. But for all these glories Abdallah cared
nothing; he hardly looked about him, but, going straight to his
room, pressed his ring and summoned the Genie.</p>

<p>“What is it that my lord would have?” asked the monster.</p>

<p>“Oh, Genie!” said poor Abdallah,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span> “I would have the princess for my
wife, for without her I am like to die.”</p>

<p>“My lord’s commands,” said the Genie, “shall be executed if I
have to tear down the city to do so. But perhaps this behest is
not so hard to fulfil. First of all, my lord will have to have an
ambassador to send to the king.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Abdallah with a sigh; “let me have an ambassador
or whatever may be necessary. Only make haste, Genie, in thy
doings.”</p>

<p>“I shall lose no time,” said the Genie; and in a moment was gone.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The king was sitting in council with all of the greatest lords of
the land gathered about him, for the Emperor of India had declared
war against him, and he and they were in debate, discussing how the
country was to be saved. Just then Abdallah’s ambassador arrived,
and when he and his train entered the council-chamber all stood up
to receive him, for the least of those attendant upon him was more
magnificently attired than the king himself, and was bedecked with
such jewels as the royal treasury could not match.</p>

<p>Kneeling before the king, the ambassador touched the ground with
his forehead. Then, still kneeling, he unrolled a scroll, written
in letters of gold, and from it read the message asking for the
princess to wife for the Lord Abdallah.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 359px;">
<img src="images/i_b_290.png" width="359" height="300" alt="the ambassador kneeled before the king and touched the ground with this forehead" />
</div>

<p>When he had ended, the king sat for a while stroking his beard and
meditating. But before he spoke the oldest lord of the council
arose and said: “O sire! if this Lord Abdallah who asks for the
princess for his wife can send such a magnificent company in the
train of his ambassador, may it not be that he may be able also to
help you in your war against the Emperor of India?”</p>

<p>“True!” said the king. Then turning to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span> ambassador: “Tell your
master,” said he, “that if he will furnish me with an army of one
hundred thousand men, to aid me in the war against the Emperor of
India, he shall have my daughter for his wife.”</p>

<p>“Sire,” said the ambassador, “I will answer now for my master, and
the answer shall be this: That he will help you with an army, not
of <em>one</em> hundred thousand, but of <em>two</em> hundred thousand men. And
if to-morrow you will be pleased to ride forth to the plain that
lieth to the south of the city, my Lord Abdallah will meet you
there with his army.” Then, once more bowing, he withdrew from the
council-chamber, leaving all them that were there amazed at what
had passed.</p>

<p>So the next day the king and all his court rode out to the place
appointed. As they drew near they saw that the whole face of the
plain was covered with a mighty host, drawn up in troops and
squadrons. As the king rode towards this vast army, Abdallah met
him, surrounded by his generals. He dismounted and would have
kneeled, but the king would not permit him, but, raising him,
kissed him upon the cheek, calling him son. Then the king and
Abdallah rode down before the ranks and the whole army waved their
swords, and the flashing of the sunlight on the blades was like
lightning, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span> shouted, and the noise was like the pealing of
thunder.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Before Abdallah marched off to the wars he and the princess were
married, and for a whole fortnight nothing was heard but the sound
of rejoicing. The city was illuminated from end to end, and all
of the fountains ran with wine instead of water. And of all those
who rejoiced, none was so happy as the princess, for never had she
seen one whom she thought so grand and noble and handsome as her
husband. After the fortnight had passed and gone, the army marched
away to the wars with Abdallah at its head.</p>

<p>Victory after victory followed, for in every engagement the Emperor
of India’s troops were driven from the field. In two months’ time
the war was over and Abdallah marched back again&mdash;the greatest
general in the world. But it was no longer as Abdallah that he was
known, but as the Emperor of India, for the former emperor had been
killed in the war, and Abdallah had set the crown upon his own head.</p>

<p>The little taste that he had had of conquest had given him an
appetite for more, so that with the armies the Genie provided
him he conquered all the neighboring countries and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span> brought them
under his rule. So he became the greatest emperor in all of the
world; kings and princes kneeled before him, and he, Abdallah, the
fagot-maker, looking about him, could say: “No one in all the world
is so great as I!”</p>

<p>Could he desire anything more?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Yes; he did! He desired to be rid of the Genie!</p>

<p>When he thought of how all that he was in power and might&mdash;he, the
Emperor of the World&mdash;how all his riches and all his glory had come
as gifts from a hideous black monster with only one eye, his heart
was filled with bitterness. “I cannot forget,” said he to himself,
“that as he has given me all these things, he may take them all
away again. Suppose that I should lose my ring and that some one
else should find it; who knows but that they might become as great
as I, and strip me of everything, as I have stripped others. Yes; I
wish he was out of the way!”</p>

<p>Once, when such thoughts as these were passing through his mind, he
was paying a visit to his father-in-law, the king. He was walking
up and down the terrace of the garden meditating on these matters,
when, leaning over a wall and looking down into the street, he saw
a fagot-maker&mdash;just such a fagot-maker as he himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span> had one time
been&mdash;driving an ass&mdash;just such an ass as he had one time driven.
The fagot-maker carried something under his arm, and what should it
be but the very casket in which the Genie had once been imprisoned,
and which he&mdash;the one-time fagot-maker&mdash;had seen the Genie kick
over the tree-tops.</p>

<p>The sight of the casket put a sudden thought into his mind. He
shouted to his attendants, and bade them haste and bring the
fagot-maker to him. Off they ran, and in a little while came
dragging the poor wretch, trembling and as white as death; for
he thought nothing less than that his end had certainly come. As
soon as those who had seized him had loosened their hold, he flung
himself prostrate at the feet of the Emperor Abdallah, and there
lay like one dead.</p>

<p>“Where didst thou get yonder casket?” asked the emperor.</p>

<p>“Oh, my lord!” croaked the poor fagot-maker, “I found it out yonder
in the woods.”</p>

<p>“Give it to me,” said the emperor, “and my treasurer shall count
thee out a thousand pieces of gold in exchange.”</p>

<p>So soon as he had the casket safe in his hands he hurried away to
his privy chamber, and there pressed the red stone in his ring.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span> “In
the name of the red Aldebaran, I command thee to appear!” said he,
and in a moment the Genie stood before him.</p>

<p>“What are my lord’s commands?” said he.</p>

<p>“I would have thee enter this casket again,” said the Emperor
Abdallah.</p>

<p>“Enter the casket!” cried the Genie, aghast.</p>

<p>“Enter the casket.”</p>

<p>“In what have I done anything to offend my lord?” said the Genie.</p>

<p>“In nothing,” said the emperor; “only I would have thee enter the
casket again as thou wert when I first found thee.”</p>

<p>It was in vain that the Genie begged and implored for mercy, it
was in vain that he reminded Abdallah of all that he had done to
benefit him; the great emperor stood as hard as a rock&mdash;into the
casket the Genie must and should go. So at last into the casket the
monster went, bellowing most lamentably.</p>

<p>The Emperor Abdallah shut the lid of the casket, and locked it and
sealed it with his seal. Then, hiding it under his cloak, he bore
it out into the garden and to a deep well, and, first making sure
that nobody was by to see, dropped casket and Genie and all into
the water.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now had that wise man been by&mdash;the wise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span> man who had laughed so
when the poor young fagot-maker wept and wailed at the ingratitude
of his friend&mdash;the wise man who had laughed still louder when the
young fagot-maker vowed that in another case he would not have been
so ungrateful to one who had benefited him&mdash;how that wise man would
have roared when he heard the casket plump into the waters of the
well! For, upon my word of honor, betwixt Ali the fagot-maker and
Abdallah the Emperor of the World there was not a pin to choose,
except in degree.</p>

</div>

<p>Once upon a time there was a king who did the best he could to rule
wisely and well, and to deal justly by those under him whom he had
to take care of; and as he could not trust hearsay, he used every
now and then to slip away out of his palace and go among his people
to hear what they had to say for themselves about him and the way
he ruled the land.</p>

<p>Well, one such day as this, when he was taking a walk, he strolled
out past the walls of the town and into the green fields until he
came at last to a fine big house that stood by the banks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span> of a
river, wherein lived a man and his wife who were very well to do in
the world. There the king stopped for a bite of bread and a drink
of fresh milk.</p>

<p>“I would like to ask you a question,” said the king to the rich
man; “and the question is this: Why are some folk rich and some
folk poor?”</p>

<p>“That I cannot tell you,” said the good man; “only I remember my
father used to say that much shall have more and little shall have
less.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the king; “the saying has a good sound, but let
us find whether or not it is really true. See; here is a purse with
three hundred pieces of golden money in it. Take it and give it to
the poorest man you know; in a week’s time I will come again, and
then you shall tell me whether it has made you or him the richer.”</p>

<p>Now in the town there lived two beggars who were as poor as poverty
itself, and the poorer of the twain was one who used to sit in rags
and tatters on the church step to beg charity of the good folk who
came and went. To him went the rich man, and, without so much as a
good-morning, quoth he: “Here is something for you,” and so saying
dropped the purse of gold into the beggar’s hat. Then away he went
without waiting for a word of thanks.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 348px;">
<img src="images/i_b_301.png" width="348" height="500" alt="the beggar counting his gold" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>As for the beggar, he just sat there for a while goggling and
staring like one moon-struck. But at last his wits came back to
him, and then away he scampered home as fast as his legs could
carry him. Then he spread his money out on the table and counted
it&mdash;three hundred pieces of gold money! He had never seen such
great riches in his life before. There he sat feasting his eyes
upon the treasure as though they would never get their fill. And
now what was he to do with all of it? Should he share his fortune
with his brother? Not a bit of it. To be sure, until now they had
always shared and shared alike, but here was the first great lump
of good-luck that had ever fallen in his way, and he was not for
spoiling it by cutting it in two to give half to a poor beggar-man
such as his brother. Not he; he would hide it and keep it all for
his very own.</p>

<p>Now, not far from where he lived, and beside the river, stood a
willow-tree, and thither the lucky beggar took his purse of money
and stuffed it into a knot-hole of a withered branch, then went
his way, certain that nobody would think of looking for money in
such a hiding-place. Then all the rest of the day he sat thinking
and thinking of the ways he would spend what had been given him,
and what he would do to get the most good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span> out of it. At last came
evening, and his brother, who had been begging in another part of
the town, came home again.</p>

<p>“I nearly lost my hat to-day,” said the second beggar so soon as he
had come into the house.</p>

<p>“Did you?” said the first beggar. “How was that?”</p>

<p>“Oh! the wind blew it off into the water, but I got it again.”</p>

<p>“How did you get it?” said the first beggar.</p>

<p>“I just broke a dead branch off of the willow-tree and drew my hat
ashore,” said the second beggar.</p>

<p>“A dead branch!!”</p>

<p>“A dead branch.”</p>

<p>“Off of the willow tree!!”</p>

<p>“Off of the willow tree.”</p>

<p>The first beggar could hardly breathe.</p>

<p>“And what did you do with the dead branch after that?”</p>

<p>“I threw it away into the water, and it floated down the river.”</p>

<p>The beggar to whom the money had been given ran out of the house
howling, and down to the river-side, thumping his head with his
knuckles like one possessed. For he knew that the branch that his
brother had broken off of the tree and had thrown into the water,
was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span> the very one in which he had hidden the bag of money.</p>

<p>Yes; and so it was.</p>

<p>The next morning, as the rich man took a walk down by the river, he
saw a dead branch that had been washed up by the tide. “Halloo!”
says he, “this will do to kindle the fire with.”</p>

<p>So he brought it to the house, and, taking down his axe, began to
split it up for kindling. The very first blow he gave, out tumbled
the bag of money.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But the beggar&mdash;well, by-and-by his grieving got better of its
first smart, and then he started off down the river to see if he
could not find his money again. He hunted up and he hunted down,
but never a whit of it did he see, and at last he stopped at the
rich man’s house and begged for a bite to eat and lodgings for
the night. There he told all his story&mdash;how he had hidden the
money that had been given him from his brother, how his brother
had broken off the branch and had thrown it away, and how he had
spent the whole live-long day searching for it. And to all the rich
man listened and said never a word. But though he said nothing,
he thought to himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span> “Maybe, after all, it is not the will of
Heaven that this man shall have the money. Nevertheless, I will
give him another trial.”</p>

<p>So he told the poor beggar to come in and stay for the night; and,
whilst the beggar was snoring away in his bed in the garret, the
rich man had his wife make two great pies, each with a fine brown
crust. In the first pie he put the little bag of money; the second
he filled full of rusty nails and scraps of iron.</p>

<p>The next morning he called the beggar to him. “My friend,” said he,
“I grieve sadly for the story you told me last night. But maybe,
after all, your luck is not all gone. And now, if you will choose
as you should choose, you shall not go away from here comfortless.
In the pantry yonder are two great pies&mdash;one is for you, and one
for me. Go in and take whichever one you please.”</p>

<p>“A pie!” thought the beggar to himself; “does the man think that
a big pie will comfort me for the loss of three hundred pieces of
money?” Nevertheless, as it was the best thing to be had, into the
pantry the beggar went and there began to feel and weigh the pies,
and the one filled with the rusty nails and scraps of iron was ever
so much the fatter and the heavier.</p>

<p>“This is the one that I shall take,” said he to the rich man, “and
you may have the other.” And, tucking it under his arm, off he
tramped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, before he got back to the town he grew hungry, and sat down
by the roadside to eat his pie; and if there was ever an angry man
in the world before, he was one that day&mdash;for there was his pie
full of nothing but rusty nails and bits of iron. “This is the way
the rich always treat the poor,” said he.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 298px;">
<img src="images/i_b_307.png" width="298" height="500" alt="the beggar sat by the roadside to eat his pie" />
</div>

<p>So back he went in a fume. “What did you give me a pie full of old
nails for?” said he.</p>

<p>“You took the pie of your own choice,” said the rich man;
“nevertheless, I meant you no harm. Lodge with me here one night,
and in the morning I will give you something better worth while,
maybe.”</p>

<p>So that night the rich man had his wife bake two loaves of bread,
in one of which she hid the bag with the three hundred pieces of
gold money.</p>

<p>“Go to the pantry,” said the rich man to the beggar in the morning,
“and there you will find two loaves of bread&mdash;one is for you and
one for me; take whichever one you choose.”</p>

<p>So in went the beggar, and the first loaf of bread he laid his hand
upon was the one in which the money was hidden, and off he marched
with it under his arm, without so much as saying thank you.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” said he to himself, after he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span> jogged along
awhile&mdash;“I wonder whether the rich man is up to another trick such
as he played upon me yesterday?” He put the loaf of bread to his
ear and shook it and shook it, and what should he hear but the
chink of the money within. “Ah ha!” said he, “he has filled it with
rusty nails and bits of iron again, but I will get the better of
him this time.”</p>

<p>By-and-by he met a poor woman coming home from market. “Would you
like to buy a fine fresh loaf of bread?” said the beggar.</p>

<p>“Yes, I would,” said the woman.</p>

<p>“Well, here is one you may have for two pennies,” said the beggar.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 361px;">
<img src="images/i_b_309.png" width="361" height="500" alt="the beggar offers the loaf to a poor woman" />
</div>

<p>That was cheap enough, so the woman paid him his price and off she
went with the loaf of bread under her arm, and never stopped until
she had come to her home.</p>

<p>Now it happened that the day before this very woman had borrowed
just such a loaf of bread from the rich man’s wife; and so, as
there was plenty in the house without it, she wrapped this loaf
up in a napkin, and sent her husband back with it to where it had
started from first of all.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the rich man to his wife, “the way of Heaven is not
to be changed.” And so he laid the money on the shelf until he who
had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span> given it to him should come again, and thought no more of
giving it to the beggar.</p>

<p>At the end of seven days the king called upon the rich man again,
and this time he came in his own guise as a real king. “Well,” said
he, “is the poor man the richer for his money?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the rich man, “he is not;” and then he told the whole
story from beginning to end just as I have told it.</p>

<p>“Your father was right,” said the king; “and what he said was very
true&mdash;‘Much shall have more and little shall have less.’ Keep the
bag of money for yourself, for there Heaven means it to stay.”</p>

<p>And maybe there is as much truth as poetry in this story.</p>

<p>Once upon a time there was a wise man of wise men, and a great
magician to boot, and his name was Doctor Simon Agricola.</p>

<p>Once upon a time there was a simpleton of simpletons, and a great
booby to boot, and his name was Babo.</p>

<p>Simon Agricola had read all the books written by man, and could do
more magic than any conjurer that ever lived. But, nevertheless, he
was none too well off in the world; his clothes were patched, and
his shoes gaped, and that is the way with many another wise man of
whom I have heard tell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>Babo gathered rushes for a chair-maker, and he also had too few of
the good things to make life easy. But it is nothing out of the way
for a simpleton to be in that case.</p>

<p>The two of them lived neighbor to neighbor, the one in the next
house to the other, and so far as the world could see there was not
a pin to choose between them&mdash;only that one was called a wise man
and the other a simpleton.</p>

<p>One day the weather was cold, and when Babo came home from
gathering rushes he found no fire in the house. So off he went to
his neighbor the wise man. “Will you give me a live coal to start
my fire?” said he.</p>

<p>“Yes, I will do that,” said Simon Agricola; “but how will you carry
the coal home?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Babo, “I will just take it in my hand.”</p>

<p>“In your hand?”</p>

<p>“In my hand.”</p>

<p>“Can you carry a live coal in your hand?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes!” said Babo; “I can do that easily enough.”</p>

<p>“Well, I should like to see you do it,” said Simon Agricola.</p>

<p>“Then I will show you,” said Babo. He spread a bed of cold, dead
ashes upon his palm. “Now,” said he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span> “I will take the ember upon
that.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 462px;">
<img src="images/i_b_315.png" width="462" height="250" alt="the wise man and the simpleton go out to make their fortune" />
</div>

<p>Agricola rolled up his eyes like a duck in a thunder-storm. “Well,”
said he, “I have lived more than seventy years, and have read all
the books in the world; I have practised magic and necromancy, and
know all about algebra and geometry, and yet, wise as I am, I never
thought of this little thing.”</p>

<p>That is the way with your wise man.</p>

<p>“Pooh!” said Babo; “that is nothing. I know how to do many more
tricks than that.”</p>

<p>“Do you?” said Simon Agricola;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span> “then listen: to-morrow I am going
out into the world to make my fortune, for little or nothing is to
be had in this town. If you will go along with me I will make your
fortune also.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Babo, and the bargain was struck. So the next
morning bright and early off they started upon their journey, cheek
by jowl, the wise man and the simpleton, to make their fortunes in
the wide world, and the two of them made a pair. On they jogged and
on they jogged, and the way was none too smooth. By-and-by they
came to a great field covered all over with round stones.</p>

<p>“Let us each take one of these,” said Simon Agricola; “they will be
of use by-and-by;” and, as he spoke, he picked up a great stone as
big as his two fists, and dropped it into the pouch that dangled at
his side.</p>

<p>“Not I,” said Babo; “I will carry no stone with me. It is as much
as my two legs can do to carry my body, let alone lugging a great
stone into the bargain.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Agricola; “’born a fool, live a fool, die a
fool.’” And on he tramped, with Babo at his heels.</p>

<p>At last they came to a great wide plain, where, far or near,
nothing was to be seen but bare sand, without so much as a pebble
or a single blade of grass, and there night caught up with them.</p>

<p>“Dear, dear, but I am hungry!” said Babo.</p>

<p>“So am I,” said Simon Agricola.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span> “Let’s sit down here and eat.”</p>

<p>So down they sat, and Simon Agricola opened his pouch and drew
forth the stone.</p>

<p>The stone? It was a stone no longer, but a fine loaf of white bread
as big as your two fists. You should have seen Babo goggle and
stare! “Give me a piece of your bread, master,” said he.</p>

<p>“Not I,” said Agricola. “You might have had a dozen of the same
kind, had you chosen to do as I bade you and to fetch them along
with you. ‘Born a fool, live a fool, die a fool,’” said he; and
that was all that Babo got for his supper. As for the wise man,
he finished his loaf of bread to the last crumb, and then went to
sleep with a full stomach and a contented mind.</p>

<p>The next morning off they started again bright and early, and
before long they came to just such another field of stones as they
left behind them the day before.</p>

<p>“Come, master,” said Babo, “let us each take a stone with us. We
may need something more to eat before the day is over.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Simon Agricola; “we will need no stones to-day.”</p>

<p>But Babo had no notion to go hungry the second time, so he hunted
around till he found a stone as big as his head. All day he carried
it, first under one arm and then under the other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span> The wise man
stepped along briskly enough, but the sweat ran down Babo’s face
like drops on the window in an April shower. At last they came to a
great wide plain, where neither stock nor stone was to be seen, but
only a gallows-tree, upon which one poor wight hung dancing upon
nothing at all, and there night caught them again.</p>

<p>“Aha!” said Babo to himself. “This time I shall have bread and my
master none.”</p>

<p>But listen to what happened. Up stepped the wise man to the
gallows, and gave it a sharp rap with his staff. Then, lo and
behold! the gallows was gone, and in its place stood a fine inn,
with lights in the windows, and a landlord bowing and smiling in
the doorway, and a fire roaring in the kitchen, and the smell of
the good things cooking filling the air all around, so that only to
sniff did one’s heart good.</p>

<p>Poor Babo let fall the stone he had carried all day. A stone it
was, and a stone he let it fall.</p>

<p>“‘Born a fool, live a fool, die a fool,’” said Agricola. “But come
in, Babo, come in; here is room enough for two.” So that night Babo
had a good supper and a sound sleep, and that is a cure for most of
a body’s troubles in this world.</p>

<p>The third day of their travelling they came to farms and villages,
and there Simon Agricola began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span> to think of showing some of those
tricks of magic that were to make his fortune and Babo’s into the
bargain.</p>

<p>At last they came to a blacksmith’s shop, and there was the smith
hard at work, dinging and donging, and making sweet music with
hammer and anvil. In walked Simon Agricola and gave him good-day.
He put his fingers into his purse, and brought out all the money
he had in the world; it was one golden angel. “Look, friend,” said
he to the blacksmith; “if you will let me have your forge for one
hour, I will give you this money for the use of it.”</p>

<p>The blacksmith liked the tune of that song very well. “You may have
it,” said he; and he took off his leathern apron without another
word, and Simon Agricola put it on in his stead.</p>

<p>Presently, who should come riding up to the blacksmith’s shop but a
rich old nobleman and three servants. The servants were hale, stout
fellows, but the nobleman was as withered as a winter leaf. “Can
you shoe my horse?” said he to Simon Agricola, for he took him to
be the smith because of his leathern apron.</p>

<p>“No,” says Simon Agricola;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span> “that is not my trade: I only know how
to make old people young.”</p>

<p>“Old people young!” said the old nobleman; “can you make me young
again?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Simon Agricola, “I can, but I must have a thousand
golden angels for doing it.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the old nobleman; “make me young, and you shall
have them and welcome.”</p>

<p>So Simon Agricola gave the word, and Babo blew the bellows until
the fire blazed and roared. Then the doctor caught the old
nobleman, and laid him upon the forge. He heaped the coals over
him, and turned him this way and that, until he grew red-hot, like
a piece of iron. Then he drew him forth from the fire and dipped
him in the water-tank. Phizz! the water hissed, and the steam rose
up in a cloud; and when Simon Agricola took the old nobleman out,
lo and behold! he was as fresh and blooming and lusty as a lad of
twenty.</p>

<p>But you should have seen how all the people stared and
goggled!&mdash;Babo and the blacksmith and the nobleman’s servants. The
nobleman strutted up and down for a while, admiring himself, and
then he got upon his horse again. “But wait,” said Simon Agricola;
“you forgot to pay me my thousand golden angels.”</p>

<p>“Pooh!” said the nobleman, and off he clattered, with his servants
at his heels; and that was all the good that Simon Agricola had of
this trick.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span> But ill-luck was not done with him yet, for when the
smith saw how matters had turned out, he laid hold of the doctor
and would not let him go until he had paid him the golden angel he
had promised for the use of the forge. The doctor pulled a sour
face, but all the same he had to pay the angel. Then the smith let
him go, and off he marched in a huff.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 444px;">
<img src="images/i_b_321.png" width="444" height="500" alt="the doctor laid the old nobleman on the forge" />
</div>

<p>Outside of the forge was the smith’s mother&mdash;a poor old creature,
withered and twisted and bent as a winter twig. Babo had kept his
eyes open, and had not travelled with Simon Agricola for nothing.
He plucked the smith by the sleeve: “Look’ee, friend,” said he,
“how would you like me to make your mother, over yonder, young
again?”</p>

<p>“I should like nothing better,” said the smith.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Babo; “give me the golden angel that the master
gave you, and I’ll do the job for you.”</p>

<p>Well, the smith paid the money, and Babo bade him blow the bellows.
When the fire roared up good and hot, he caught up the old mother,
and, in spite of her scratching and squalling, he laid her upon the
embers. By-and-by, when he thought the right time had come, he took
her out and dipped her in the tank of water; but instead of turning
young, there she lay, as dumb as a fish and as black as coal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>When the blacksmith saw what Babo had done to his mother, he caught
him by the collar, and fell to giving him such a dressing down as
never man had before.</p>

<p>“Help!” bawled Babo. “Help! Murder!”</p>

<p>Such a hubbub had not been heard in that town for many a day. Back
came Simon Agricola running, and there he saw, and took it all in
in one look.</p>

<p>“Stop, friend,” said he to the smith, “let the simpleton go; this
is not past mending yet.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the smith; “but he must give me back my golden
angel, and you must cure my mother, or else I’ll have you both up
before the judge.”</p>

<p>“It shall be done,” said Simon Agricola; so Babo paid back the
money, and the doctor dipped the woman in the water. When he
brought her out she was as well and strong as ever&mdash;but just as old
as she had been before.</p>

<p>“Now be off for a pair of scamps, both of you,” said the
blacksmith; “and if you ever come this way again, I’ll set all the
dogs in the town upon you.”</p>

<p>Simon Agricola said nothing until they had come out upon the
highway again, and left the town well behind them; then&mdash;“‘Born a
fool, live a fool, die a fool!’” says he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>Babo said nothing, but he rubbed the places where the smith had
dusted his coat.</p>

<p>The fourth day of their journey they came to a town, and here
Simon Agricola was for trying his tricks of magic again. He and
Babo took up their stand in the corner of the market-place, and
began bawling, “Doctor Knowall! Doctor Knowall! who has come from
the other end of Nowhere! He can cure any sickness or pain! He can
bring you back from the gates of death! Here is Doctor Knowall!
Here is Doctor Knowall!”</p>

<p>Now there was a very, very rich man in that town, whose daughter
lay sick to death; and when the news of this great doctor was
brought to his ears, he was for having him try his hand at curing
the girl.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Simon Agricola, “I will do that, but you must pay
me two thousand golden angels.”</p>

<p>“Two thousand golden angels!” said the rich man; “that is a great
deal of money, but you shall have it if only you will cure my
daughter.”</p>

<p>Simon Agricola drew a little vial from his bosom. From it he poured
just six drops of yellow liquor upon the girl’s tongue. Then&mdash;lo
and behold!&mdash;up she sat in bed as well and strong as ever, and
asked for a boiled chicken and a dumpling, by way of something to
eat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>“Bless you! Bless you!” said the rich man.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes; blessings are very good, but I would like to have my two
thousand golden angels,” said Simon Agricola.</p>

<p>“Two thousand golden angels! I said nothing about two thousand
golden angels,” said the rich man; “two thousand fiddlesticks!”
said he. “Pooh! pooh! you must have been dreaming! See, here are
two hundred silver pennies, and that is enough and more than enough
for six drops of medicine.”</p>

<p>“I want my two thousand golden angels,” said Simon Agricola.</p>

<p>“You will get nothing but two hundred pennies,” said the rich man.</p>

<p>“I won’t touch one of them,” said Simon Agricola, and off he
marched in a huff.</p>

<p>But Babo had kept his eyes open. Simon Agricola had laid down the
vial upon the table, and while they were saying this and that back
and forth, thinking of nothing else, Babo quietly slipped it into
his own pocket, without any one but himself being the wiser.</p>

<p>Down the stairs stumped the doctor with Babo at his heels. There
stood the cook waiting for them.</p>

<p>“Look,” said he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span> “my wife is sick in there; won’t you cure her,
too?”</p>

<p>“Pooh!” said Simon Agricola; and out he went, banging the door
behind him.</p>

<p>“Look, friend,” said Babo to the cook; “here I have some of the
same medicine. Give me the two hundred pennies that the master
would not take, and I’ll cure her for you as sound as a bottle.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the cook, and he counted out the two hundred
pennies, and Babo slipped them into his pocket. He bade the woman
open her mouth, and when she had done so he poured all the stuff
down her throat at once.</p>

<p>“Ugh!” said she, and therewith rolled up her eyes, and lay as stiff
and dumb as a herring in a box.</p>

<p>When the cook saw what Babo had done, he snatched up the
rolling-pin and made at him to pound his head to a jelly. But Babo
did not wait for his coming; he jumped out of the window, and away
he scampered with the cook at his heels.</p>

<p>Well, the upshot of the business was that Simon Agricola had to go
back and bring life to the woman again, or the cook would thump him
and Babo both with the rolling-pin. And, what was more, Babo had to
pay back the two hundred pennies that the cook had given him for
curing his wife.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 171px;">
<img src="images/i_b_327.png" width="171" height="500" alt="the cook chasing Babo with a rolling-pin" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>The wise man made a cross upon the woman’s forehead, and up she
sat, as well&mdash;but no better&mdash;as before.</p>

<p>“And now be off,” said the cook, “or I will call the servants and
give you both a drubbing for a pair of scamps.”</p>

<p>Simon Agricola said never a word until they had gotten out of
the town. There his anger boiled over, like water into the fire.
“Look,” said he to Babo: “‘Born a fool, live a fool, die a fool.’ I
want no more of you. Here are two roads; you take one, and I will
take the other.”</p>

<p>“What!” said Babo, “am I to travel the rest of the way alone? And
then, besides, how about the fortune you promised me?”</p>

<p>“Never mind that,” said Simon Agricola; “I have not made my own
fortune yet.”</p>

<p>“Well, at least pay me something for my wages,” said Babo.</p>

<p>“How shall I pay you?” said Simon Agricola. “I have not a single
groat in the world.”</p>

<p>“What!” said Babo, “have you nothing to give me?”</p>

<p>“I can give you a piece of advice.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Babo, “that is better than nothing, so let me have it.”</p>

<p>“Here it is,” said Simon Agricola:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span> “‘Think well! think
well!&mdash;before you do what you are about to do, think well!’”</p>

<p>“Thank you!” said Babo; and then the one went one way, and the
other the other.</p>

<p>(<i>You may go with the wise man if you choose, but I shall jog along
with the simpleton.</i>)</p>

<p>After Babo had travelled for a while, he knew not whither, night
caught him, and he lay down under a hedge to sleep. There he lay,
and snored away like a saw-mill, for he was wearied with his long
journeying.</p>

<p>Now it chanced that that same night two thieves had broken into a
miser’s house, and had stolen an iron pot full of gold money. Day
broke before they reached home, so down they sat to consider the
matter; and the place where they seated themselves was on the other
side of the hedge where Babo lay. The older thief was for carrying
the money home under his coat; the younger was for burying it until
night had come again. They squabbled and bickered and argued till
the noise they made wakened Babo, and he sat up. The first thing he
thought of was the advice that the doctor had given him the evening
before.</p>

<p>“‘Think well!’” he bawled out;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span> “‘think well! before you do what
you are about to do, think well!’”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 452px;">
<img src="images/i_b_330.png" width="452" height="200" alt="the two thieves sat down to consider the matter" />
</div>

<p>When the two thieves heard Babo’s piece of advice, they thought
that the judge’s officers were after them for sure and certain.
Down they dropped the pot of money, and away they scampered as fast
as their legs could carry them.</p>

<p>Babo heard them running, and poked his head through the hedge, and
there lay the pot of gold. “Look now,” said he: “this has come from
the advice that was given me; no one ever gave me advice that was
worth so much before.” So he picked up the pot of gold, and off he
marched with it.</p>

<p>He had not gone far before he met two of the king’s officers,
and you may guess how they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span> opened their eyes when they saw him
travelling along the highway with a pot full of gold money.</p>

<p>“Where are you going with that money?” said they.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Babo.</p>

<p>“How did you get it?” said they.</p>

<p>“I got it for a piece of advice,” said Babo.</p>

<p>For a piece of advice! No, no&mdash;the king’s officers knew butter from
lard, and truth from t’other thing. It was just the same in that
country as it is in our town&mdash;there was nothing in the world so
cheap as advice. Whoever heard of anybody giving a pot of gold and
silver money for it? Without another word they marched Babo and his
pot of money off to the king.</p>

<p>“Come,” said the king, “tell me truly; where did you get the pot of
money?”</p>

<p>Poor Babo began to whimper. “I got it for a piece of advice,” said
he.</p>

<p>“Really and truly?” said the king.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Babo; “really and truly.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” said the king. “I should like to have advice that is worth
as much as that. Now, how much will you sell your advice to me for?”</p>

<p>“How much will you give?” said Babo.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the king,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span> “let me have it for a day on trial, and at
the end of that time I will pay you what it is worth.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Babo, “that is a bargain;” and so he lent the
king his piece of advice for one day on trial.</p>

<p>Now the chief councillor and some others had laid a plot against
the king’s life, and that morning it had been settled that when the
barber shaved him he was to cut his throat with a razor. So after
the barber had lathered his face he began to whet the razor, and to
whet the razor.</p>

<p>Just at that moment the king remembered Babo’s piece of advice.
“‘Think well!’ said he; ‘think well! before you do what you are
about to do, think well!’”</p>

<p>When the barber heard the words that the king said, he thought that
all had been discovered. Down he fell upon his knees, and confessed
everything.</p>

<p>That is how Babo’s advice saved the king’s life&mdash;you can guess
whether the king thought it was worth much or little. When Babo
came the next morning the king gave him ten chests full of money,
and that made the simpleton richer than anybody in all that land.</p>

<p>He built himself a fine house, and by-and-by married the daughter
of the new councillor that came after the other one’s head had been
chopped off for conspiring against the king’s life. Besides that,
he came and went about the king’s castle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span> as he pleased, and the
king made much of him. Everybody bowed to him, and all were glad to
stop and chat awhile with him when they met him in the street.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 517px;">
<img src="images/i_b_333.png" width="517" height="500" alt="the barber fell on his knees and confessed everything to the king" />
</div>

<p>One morning Babo looked out of the window, and who should he see
come travelling along the road but Simon Agricola himself, and he
was just as poor and dusty and travel-stained as ever.</p>

<p>“Come in, come in!” said Babo; and you can guess how the wise man
stared when he saw the simpleton living in such a fine way. But he
opened his eyes wider than ever when he heard that all these good
things came from the piece of advice he had given Babo that day
they had parted at the cross roads.</p>

<p>“Aye, aye!” said he, “the luck is with you for sure and certain.
But if you will pay me a thousand golden angels, I will give you
something better than a piece of advice. I will teach you all the
magic that is to be learned from the books.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Babo, “I am satisfied with the advice.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Simon Agricola, “‘Born a fool, live a fool, die a
fool’”; and off he went in a huff.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That is all of this tale except the tip end of it, and that I will
give you now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>I have heard tell that one day the king dropped in the street the
piece of advice that he had bought from Babo, and that before he
found it again it had been trampled into the mud and dirt. I cannot
say for certain that this is the truth, but it must have been
spoiled in some way or other, for I have never heard of anybody in
these days who would give even so much as a bad penny for it; and
yet it is worth just as much now as it was when Babo sold it to the
king.</p>

Blacksmith had ended his story, and methought they liked it better

to break the silence. “I would like,” said I (and my voice sounded
thin in my own ears, as one’s voice always does sound in Twilight
Land), “I would like to hear our friend Sindbad the Sailor tell a

<h2><a name="The_Enchanted_Island" id="The_Enchanted_Island"></a>The Enchanted Island.</h2>

<p><i>But it is not always the lucky one that carries away the plums;
sometimes he only shakes the tree, and the wise man pockets the
fruit.</i></p>


<p>Once upon a long, long time ago, and in a country far, far away,
there lived two men in the same town and both were named Selim; one
was Selim the Baker and one was Selim the Fisherman.</p>

<p>Selim the Baker was well off in the world, but Selim the Fisherman
was only so-so. Selim the Baker always had plenty to eat and a
warm corner in cold weather, but many and many a time Selim the
Fisherman’s stomach went empty and his teeth went chattering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>Once it happened that for time after time Selim the Fisherman
caught nothing but bad luck in his nets, and not so much as a
single sprat, and he was very hungry. “Come,” said he to himself,
“those who have some should surely give to those who have none,”
and so he went to Selim the Baker. “Let me have a loaf of bread,”
said he, “and I will pay you for it to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Selim the Baker; “I will let you have a loaf
of bread, if you will give me all that you catch in your nets
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“So be it,” said Selim the Fisherman, for need drives one to hard
bargains sometimes; and therewith he got his loaf of bread.</p>

<p>So the next day Selim the Fisherman fished and fished and fished
and fished, and still he caught no more than the day before; until
just at sunset he cast his net for the last time for the day, and,
lo and behold! there was something heavy in it. So he dragged it
ashore, and what should it be but a leaden box, sealed as tight as
wax, and covered with all manner of strange letters and figures.
“Here,” said he, “is something to pay for my bread of yesterday, at
any rate;” and as he was an honest man, off he marched with it to
Selim the Baker.</p>

<p>They opened the box in the baker’s shop, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span> within they found
two rolls of yellow linen. In each of the rolls of linen was
another little leaden box: in one was a finger-ring of gold set
with a red stone, in the other was a finger-ring of iron set with
nothing at all.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 262px;">
<img src="images/i_b_339.png" width="262" height="500" alt="Selim the Fisherman catches a box" />
</div>

<p>That was all the box held; nevertheless, that was the greatest
catch that ever any fisherman made in the world; for, though Selim
the one or Selim the other knew no more of the matter than the cat
under the stove, the gold ring was the Ring of Luck and the iron
ring was the Ring of Wisdom.</p>

<p>Inside of the gold ring were carved these letters: “Whosoever wears
me, shall have that which all men seek&mdash;for so it is with good-luck
in this world.”</p>

<p>Inside of the iron ring were written these words: “Whosoever wears
me, shall have that which few men care for&mdash;and that is the way it
is with wisdom in our town.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Selim the Baker, and he slipped the gold ring of
good-luck on his finger, “I have driven a good bargain, and you
have paid for your loaf of bread.”</p>

<p>“But what will you do with the other ring?” said Selim the
Fisherman.</p>

<p>“Oh, you may have that,” said Selim the Baker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, that evening, as Selim the Baker sat in front of his shop
in the twilight smoking a pipe of tobacco, the ring he wore began
to work. Up came a little old man with a white beard, and he was
dressed all in gray from top to toe, and he wore a black velvet
cap, and he carried a long staff in his hand. He stopped in front
of Selim the Baker, and stood looking at him a long, long time. At
last&mdash;“Is your name Selim?” said he.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Selim the Baker, “it is.”</p>

<p>“And do you wear a gold ring with a red stone on your finger?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Selim, “I do.”</p>

<p>“Then come with me,” said the little old man, “and I will show you
the wonder of the world.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Selim the Baker, “that will be worth the seeing, at
any rate.” So he emptied out his pipe of tobacco, and put on his
hat and followed the way the old man led.</p>

<p>Up one street they went, and down another, and here and there
through alleys and byways where Selim had never been before. At
last they came to where a high wall ran along the narrow street,
with a garden behind it, and by-and-by to an iron gate. The old man
rapped upon the gate three times with his knuckles, and cried in a
loud voice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span> “Open to Selim, who wears the Ring of Luck!”</p>

<p>Then instantly the gate swung open, and Selim the Baker followed
the old man into the garden.</p>

<p>Bang! shut the gate behind him, and there he was.</p>

<p>There he was! And such a place he had never seen before. Such
fruit! such flowers! such fountains! such summer-houses!</p>

<p>“This is nothing,” said the old man; “this is only the beginning of
wonder. Come with me.”</p>

<p>He led the way down a long pathway between the trees, and Selim
followed. By-and-by, far away, they saw the light of torches; and
when they came to what they saw, lo and behold! there was the
sea-shore, and a boat with four-and-twenty oarsmen, each dressed
in cloth of gold and silver more splendidly than a prince. And
there were four-and-twenty black slaves, carrying each a torch of
spice-wood, so that all the air was filled with sweet smells. The
old man led the way, and Selim, following, entered the boat; and
there was a seat for him made soft with satin cushions embroidered
with gold and precious stones and stuffed with down, and Selim
wondered whether he was not dreaming.</p>

<p>The oarsmen pushed off from the shore and away they rowed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 298px;">
<img src="images/i_b_343.png" width="298" height="500" alt="the old man and Selim the baker enter the garden through the gate" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>On they rowed and on they rowed for all that livelong night.</p>

<p>At last morning broke, and then as the sun rose Selim saw such
a sight as never mortal eyes beheld before or since. It was the
wonder of wonders&mdash;a great city built on an island. The island was
all one mountain; and on it, one above another and another above
that again, stood palaces that glistened like snow, and orchards of
fruit, and gardens of flowers and green trees.</p>

<p>And as the boat came nearer and nearer to the city, Selim could see
that all around on the house-tops and down to the water’s edge were
crowds and crowds of people. All were looking out towards the sea,
and when they saw the boat and Selim in it, a great shout went up
like the roaring of rushing waters.</p>

<p>“It is the King!” they cried&mdash;“it is the King! It is Selim the
King!”</p>

<p>Then the boat landed, and there stood dozens and scores of great
princes and nobles to welcome Selim when he came ashore. And there
was a white horse waiting for him to ride, and its saddle and
bridle were studded with diamonds and rubies and emeralds that
sparkled and glistened like the stars in heaven, and Selim thought
for sure he must be dreaming with his eyes open.</p>

<p>But he was not dreaming, for it was all as true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span> as that eggs are
eggs. So up the hill he rode, and to the grandest and the most
splendid of all the splendid palaces, the princes and noblemen
riding with him, and the crowd shouting as though to split their
throats.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 441px;">
<img src="images/i_b_345.png" width="441" height="500" alt="the dancing of the beautiful dancing-girls" />
</div>

<p>And what a palace it was!&mdash;as white as snow and painted all inside
with gold and blue. All around it were gardens blooming with fruit
and flowers, and the like of it mortal man never saw in the world
before.</p>

<p>There they made a king of Selim, and put a golden crown on his
head; and that is what the Ring of Good Luck can do for a baker.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But wait a bit! There was something queer about it all, and that is
now to be told.</p>

<p>All that day was feasting and drinking and merry-making, and
the twinging and twanging of music, and dancing of beautiful
dancing-girls, and such things as Selim had never heard tell of in
all his life before. And when night came they lit thousands and
thousands of candles of perfumed wax; so that it was a hard matter
to say when night began and day ended, only that the one smelled
sweeter than the other.</p>

<p>But at last it came midnight, and then suddenly, in an instant,
all the lights went out and everything was as dark as pitch&mdash;not
a spark, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span> a glimmer anywhere. And, just as suddenly, all the
sound of music and dancing and merrymaking ceased, and everybody
began to wail and cry until it was enough to wring one’s heart to
hear. Then, in the midst of all the wailing and crying, a door was
flung open, and in came six tall and terrible black men, dressed
all in black from top to toe, carrying each a flaming torch; and by
the light of the torches King Selim saw that all&mdash;the princes, the
noblemen, the dancing-girls&mdash;all lay on their faces on the floor.</p>

<p>The six men took King Selim&mdash;who shuddered and shook with fear&mdash;by
the arms, and marched him through dark, gloomy entries and
passageways, until they came at last to the very heart of the
palace.</p>

<p>There was a great high-vaulted room all of black marble, and in
the middle of it was a pedestal with seven steps, all of black
marble; and on the pedestal stood a stone statue of a woman looking
as natural as life, only that her eyes were shut. The statue was
dressed like a queen: she wore a golden crown on her head, and upon
her body hung golden robes, set with diamonds and emeralds and
rubies and sapphires and pearls and all sorts of precious stones.</p>

<p>As for the face of the statue, white paper and black ink could not
tell you how beautiful it was.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span> When Selim looked at it, it made
his heart stand still in his breast, it was so beautiful.</p>

<p>The six men brought Selim up in front of the statue, and then a
voice came as though from the vaulted roof: “Selim! Selim! Selim!”
it said, “what art thou doing? To-day is feasting and drinking and
merry-making, but beware of to-morrow!”</p>

<p>As soon as these words were ended the six black men marched King
Selim back whence they had brought him; there they left him and
passed out one by one as they had first come in, and the door shut
to behind them.</p>

<p>Then in an instant the lights flashed out again, the music began to
play and the people began to talk and laugh, and King Selim thought
that maybe all that had just passed was only a bit of an ugly dream
after all.</p>

<p>So that is the way King Selim the Baker began to reign, and that is
the way he continued to reign. All day was feasting and drinking
and making merry and music and laughing and talking. But every
night at midnight the same thing happened: the lights went out, all
the people began wailing and crying, and the six tall, terrible
black men came with flashing torches and marched King Selim away to
the beautiful statue. And every night the same voice said&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>“Selim!
Selim! Selim! What art thou doing? To-day is feasting and drinking
and merry-making; but beware of to-morrow!”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 426px;">
<img src="images/i_b_349.png" width="426" height="500" alt="six tall, teribble black men with torches marched King Selim to the statue" />
</div>

<p>So things went on for a twelvemonth, and at last came the end of
the year. That day and night the merry-making was merrier and
wilder and madder than it had ever been before, but the great
clock in the tower went on&mdash;tick, tock! tick, tock!&mdash;and by and by
it came midnight. Then, as it always happened before, the lights
went out, and all was as black as ink. But this time there was no
wailing and crying out, but everything as silent as death; the
door opened slowly, and in came, not six black men as before, but
nine men as silent as death, dressed all in flaming red, and the
torches they carried burned as red as blood. They took King Selim
by the arms, just as the six men had done, and marched him through
the same entries and passageways, and so came at last to the same
vaulted room. There stood the statue, but now it was turned to
flesh and blood, and the eyes were open and looking straight at
Selim the Baker.</p>

<p>“Art thou Selim?” said she; and she pointed her finger straight at
him.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am Selim,” said he.</p>

<p>“And dost thou wear the gold ring with the red stone?” said she.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” said he; “I have it on my finger.”</p>

<p>“And dost thou wear the iron ring?”</p>

<p>“No,” said he; “I gave that to Selim the Fisherman.”</p>

<p>The words had hardly left his lips when the statue gave a great
cry and clapped her hands together. In an instant an echoing cry
sounded all over the town&mdash;a shriek fit to split the ears.</p>

<p>The next moment there came another sound&mdash;a sound like
thunder&mdash;above and below and everywhere. The earth began to shake
and to rock, and the houses began to topple and fall, and the
people began to scream and to yell and to shout, and the waters of
the sea began to lash and to roar, and the wind began to bellow and
howl. Then it was a good thing for King Selim that he wore Luck’s
Ring; for, though all the beautiful snow-white palace about him and
above him began to crumble to pieces like slaked lime, the sticks
and the stones and the beams to fall this side of him and that, he
crawled out from under it without a scratch or a bruise, like a rat
out of a cellar.</p>

<p>That is what Luck’s Ring did for him.</p>

<p>But his troubles were not over yet; for, just as he came out from
under all the ruin, the island began to sink down into the water,
carrying everything along with it&mdash;that is, everything but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span> him and
one thing else. That one other thing was an empty boat, and King
Selim climbed into it, and nothing else saved him from drowning. It
was Luck’s Ring that did that for him also.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 395px;">
<img src="images/i_b_352.png" width="395" height="200" alt="Selim the baker went ashore on the island" />
</div>

<p>The boat floated on and on until it came to another island that was
just like the island he had left, only that there was neither tree
nor blade of grass nor hide nor hair nor living thing of any kind.
Nevertheless, it was an island just like the other: a high mountain
and nothing else. There Selim the Baker went ashore, and there he
would have starved to death only for Luck’s Ring; for one day a
boat came sailing by, and when poor Selim shouted, those aboard
heard him and came and took him off. How they all stared to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
his golden crown&mdash;for he still wore it&mdash;and his robes of silk and
satin and the gold and jewels!</p>

<p>Before they would consent to carry him away, they made him give up
all the fine things he had. Then they took him home again to the
town whence he had first come, just as poor as when he had started.
Back he went to his bake-shop and his ovens, and the first thing he
did was to take off his gold ring and put it on the shelf.</p>

<p>“If that is the ring of good luck,” said he, “I do not want to wear
the like of it.”</p>

<p>That is the way with mortal man: for one has to have the Ring of
Wisdom as well, to turn the Ring of Luck to good account.</p>

<p>And now for Selim the Fisherman.</p>

<p>Well, thus it happened to him. For a while he carried the iron ring
around in his pocket&mdash;just as so many of us do&mdash;without thinking
to put it on. But one day he slipped it on his finger&mdash;and that is
what we do not all of us do. After that he never took it off again,
and the world went smoothly with him. He was not rich, but then he
was not poor; he was not merry, neither was he sad. He always had
enough and was thankful for it, for I never yet knew wisdom to go
begging or crying.</p>

<p>So he went his way and he fished his fish, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span> twelve months and
a week or more passed by. Then one day he went past the baker shop
and there sat Selim the Baker smoking his pipe of tobacco.</p>

<p>“So, friend,” said Selim the Fisherman, “you are back again in the
old place, I see.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the other Selim; “awhile ago I was a king, and now I
am nothing but a baker again. As for that gold ring with the red
stone&mdash;they may say it is Luck’s Ring if they choose, but when next
I wear it may I be hanged.”</p>

<p>Thereupon he told Selim the Fisherman the story of what had
happened to him with all its ins and outs, just as I have told it
to you.</p>

<p>“Well!” said Selim the Fisherman, “I should like to have a sight
of that island myself. If you want the ring no longer, just let me
have it; for maybe if I wear it something of the kind will happen
to me.”</p>

<p>“You may have it,” said Selim the Baker. “Yonder it is, and you are
welcome to it.”</p>

<p>So Selim the Fisherman put on the ring, and then went his way about
his own business.</p>

<p>That night, as he came home carrying his nets over his shoulder,
whom should he meet but the little old man in gray, with the white
beard and the black cap on his head and the long staff in his hand.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 323px;">
<img src="images/i_b_355.png" width="323" height="500" alt="Slim the Fisherman, carrying home his nets, met the little old man" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is your name Selim?” said the little man, just as he had done to
Selim the Baker.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Selim; “it is.”</p>

<p>“And do you wear a gold ring with a red stone?” said the little old
man, just as he had said before.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Selim; “I do.”</p>

<p>“Then come with me,” said the little old man, “and I will show you
the wonder of the world.”</p>

<p>Selim the Fisherman remembered all that Selim the Baker had told
him, and he took no two thoughts as to what to do. Down he tumbled
his nets, and away he went after the other as fast as his legs
could carry him. Here they went and there they went, up crooked
streets and lanes and down by-ways and alley-ways, until at last
they came to the same garden to which Selim the Baker had been
brought. Then the old man knocked at the gate three times and cried
out in a loud voice, “Open! Open! Open to Selim who wears the Ring
of Luck!”</p>

<p>Then the gate opened, and in they went. Fine as it all was, Selim
the Fisherman cared to look neither to the right nor to the left,
but straight after the old man he went, until at last they came to
the seaside and the boat and the four-and-twenty oarsmen dressed
like princes and the black slaves with the perfumed torches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<p>Here the old man entered the boat and Selim after him, and away
they sailed.</p>

<p>To make a long story short, everything happened to Selim the
Fisherman just as it had happened to Selim the Baker. At dawn of
day they came to the island and the city built on the mountain.
And the palaces were just as white and beautiful, and the gardens
and orchards just as fresh and blooming as though they had not
all tumbled down and sunk under the water a week before, almost
carrying poor Selim the Baker with them. There were the people
dressed in silks and satins and jewels, just as Selim the Baker had
found them, and they shouted and hurrahed for Selim the Fisherman
just as they had shouted and hurrahed for the other. There were the
princes and the nobles and the white horse, and Selim the Fisherman
got on his back and rode up to the dazzling snow-white palace, and
they put a crown on his head and made a king of him, just as they
had made a king of Selim the Baker.</p>

<p>That night, at midnight, it happened just as it had happened
before. Suddenly, as the hour struck, the lights all went out, and
there was a moaning and a crying enough to make the heart curdle.
Then the door flew open, and in came the six terrible black men
with torches. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span> led Selim the Fisherman through damp and dismal
entries and passage-ways until they came to the vaulted room of
black marble, and there stood the beautiful statue on its black
pedestal. Then came the voice from above&mdash;“Selim! Selim! Selim!” it
cried, “what art thou doing? To-day is feasting and drinking and
merry-making, but beware of to-morrow!”</p>

<p>But Selim the Fisherman did not stand still and listen, as Selim
the Baker had done. He called out, “I hear the words! I am
listening! I will beware to-day for the sake of to-morrow!”</p>

<p>I do not know what I should have done had I been king of that
island and had I known that in a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original text was 'twelve-month'">twelvemonth</ins> it would all come
tumbling down about my ears and sink into the sea, maybe carry me
along with it. This is what Selim the Fisherman did [but then he
wore the iron Ring of Wisdom on his finger, and I never had that
upon mine]:</p>

<p>First of all, he called the wisest men of the island to him, and
found from them just where the other desert island lay upon which
the boat with Selim the Baker in it had drifted.</p>

<p>Then, when he had learned where it was to be found, he sent armies
and armies of men and built on that island palaces and houses, and
planted there orchards and gardens, just like the palaces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span> and
the orchards and the gardens about him&mdash;only a great deal finer.
Then he sent fleets and fleets of ships, and carried everything
away from the island where he lived to that other island&mdash;all the
men and the women and the children; all the flocks and herds and
every living thing; all the fowls and the birds and everything that
wore feathers; all the gold and the silver and the jewels and the
silks and the satins, and whatever was of any good or of any use;
and when all these things were done, there were still two days left
till the end of the year.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 371px;">
<img src="images/i_b_359.png" width="371" height="500" alt="he called the wisest men of the island to him" />
</div>

<p>Upon the first of these two days he sent over the beautiful statue
and had it set up in the very midst of the splendid new palace he
had built.</p>

<p>Upon the second day he went over himself, leaving behind him
nothing but the dead mountain and the rocks and the empty houses.</p>

<p>So came the end of the twelve months.</p>

<p>So came midnight.</p>

<p>Out went all the lights in the new palace, and everything was as
silent as death and as black as ink. The door opened, and in came
the nine men in red, with torches burning as red as blood. They
took Selim the Fisherman by the arms and led him to the beautiful
statue, and there she was with her eyes open.</p>

<p>“Are you Selim?” said she.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 395px;">
<img src="images/i_b_361.png" width="395" height="500" alt="Selim the Fisherman meets the statue with her eyes open" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, I am Selim,” said he.</p>

<p>“And do you wear the iron Ring of Wisdom?” said she.</p>

<p>“Yes, I do,” said he; and so he did.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There was no roaring and thundering, there was no shaking and
quaking, there was no toppling and tumbling, there was no splashing
and dashing: for this island was solid rock, and was not all
enchantment and hollow inside and underneath like the other which
he had left behind.</p>

<p>The beautiful statue smiled until the place lit up as though the
sun shone. Down she came from the pedestal where she stood and
kissed Selim the Fisherman on the lips.</p>

<p>Then instantly the lights blazed everywhere, and the people shouted
and cheered, and the music played. But neither Selim the Fisherman
nor the beautiful statue saw or heard anything.</p>

<p>“I have done all this for you!” said Selim the Fisherman.</p>

<p>“And I have been waiting for you a thousand years!” said the
beautiful statue&mdash;only she was not a statue any longer.</p>

<p>After that they were married, and Selim the Fisherman and the
enchanted statue became king and queen in real earnest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>I think Selim the Fisherman sent for Selim the Baker and made him
rich and happy&mdash;I hope he did&mdash;I am sure he did.</p>

<p>So, after all, it is not always the lucky one who gathers the plums
when wisdom is by to pick up what the other shakes down.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I could say more; for, O little children! little children! there is
more than meat in many an egg-shell; and many a fool tells a story
that joggles a wise man’s wits, and many a man dances and junkets
in his fool’s paradise till it comes tumbling down about his ears
some day; and there are few men who are like Selim the Fisherman,
who wear the Ring of Wisdom on their finger, and, alack-a-day! I am
not one of them, and that is the end of this story.</p>

<p><i>Old Bidpai nodded his head. “Aye, aye,” said he, “there is a
very good moral in that story, my friend. It is, as a certain
philosopher said, very true, that there is more in an egg than
the meat. And truly, methinks, there is more in thy story than
the story of itself.” He nodded his head again and stroked his
beard slowly, puffing out as he did so a great reflective cloud of
smoke, through which his eyes shone and twinkled mistily like stars

Then, without waiting for any one to say another word, he began it
in these words. “I am going to tell you,” said he, how&mdash;</i></p>

<p>Once upon a time, in the old, old days, there lived a king who had
a head upon his shoulders wiser than other folk, and this was why:
though he was richer and wiser and greater than most kings, and
had all that he wanted and more into the bargain, he was so afraid
of becoming proud of his own prosperity that he had these words

his palace:</p>

<p class="center"><em>All Things are as Fate wills.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, by-and-by and after a while the king died; for when his time
comes, even the rich and the wise man must die, as well as the poor
and the simple man. So the king’s son came, in turn, to be king of
that land; and, though he was not so bad as the world of men goes,
he was not the man that his father was, as this story will show you.</p>

<p>One day, as he sat with his chief councillor, his eyes fell upon
the words written in letters of gold upon the wall&mdash;the words that
his father had written there in time gone by:</p>

<p class="center"><em>All Things are as Fate wills</em>;</p>

<p>and the young king did not like the taste of them, for he was very
proud of his own greatness. “That is not so,” said he, pointing to
the words on the wall. “Let them be painted out, and these words
written in their place:</p>

<p class="center"><em>All Things are as Man does.</em>”</p>

<p>Now, the chief councillor was a grave old man, and had been
councillor to the young king’s father. “Do not be too hasty, my
lord king,” said he. “Try first the truth of your own words before
you wipe out those that your father has written.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 275px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span></p>

<p>“Very well,” said the young king, “so be it. I will approve the
truth of my words. Bring me hither some beggar from the town whom
Fate has made poor, and I will make him rich. So I will show you
that his life shall be as I will, and not as Fate wills.”</p>

<p>Now, in that town there was a poor beggar-man who used to sit every
day beside the town gate, begging for something for charity’s sake.
Sometimes people gave him a penny or two, but it was little or
nothing that he got, for Fate was against him.</p>

<p>The same day that the king and the chief councillor had had their
talk together, as the beggar sat holding up his wooden bowl and
asking charity of those who passed by, there suddenly came three
men who, without saying a word, clapped hold of him and marched him
off.</p>

<p>It was in vain that the beggar talked and questioned&mdash;in vain that
he begged and besought them to let him go. Not a word did they say
to him, either of good or bad. At last they came to a gate that led
through a high wall and into a garden, and there the three stopped,
and one of them knocked upon the gate. In answer to his knocking it
flew open. He thrust the beggar into the garden neck and crop, and
then the gate was banged to again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p>

<p>But what a sight it was the beggar saw before his eyes!&mdash;flowers,
and fruit-trees, and marble walks, and a great fountain that shot
up a jet of water as white as snow. But he had not long to stand
gaping and staring around him, for in the garden were a great
number of people, who came hurrying to him, and who, without
speaking a word to him or answering a single question, or as much
as giving him time to think, led him to a marble bath of tepid
water. There he was stripped of his tattered clothes and washed
as clean as snow. Then, as some of the attendants dried him with
fine linen towels, others came carrying clothes fit for a prince to
wear, and clad the beggar in them from head to foot. After that,
still without saying a word, they let him out from the bath again,
and there he found still other attendants waiting for him&mdash;two of
them holding a milk-white horse, saddled and bridled, and fit for
an emperor to ride. These helped him to mount, and then, leaping
into their own saddles, rode away with the beggar in their midst.</p>

<p>They rode out of the garden and into the streets, and on and on
they went until they came to the king’s palace, and there they
stopped. Courtiers and noblemen and great lords were waiting for
their coming, some of whom helped him to dismount from the horse,
for by this time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span> the beggar was so overcome with wonder that he
stared like one moon-struck, and as though his wits were addled.
Then, leading the way up the palace steps, they conducted him
from room to room, until at last they came to one more grand and
splendid than all the rest, and there sat the king himself waiting
for the beggar’s coming.</p>

<p>The beggar would have flung himself at the king’s feet, but the
king would not let him; for he came down from the throne where he
sat, and, taking the beggar by the hand, led him up and sat him
alongside of him. Then the king gave orders to the attendants who
stood about, and a feast was served in plates of solid gold upon a
table-cloth of silver&mdash;a feast such as the beggar had never dreamed
of, and the poor man ate as he had never eaten in his life before.</p>

<p>All the while that the king and the beggar were eating, musicians
played sweet music and dancers danced and singers sang.</p>

<p>Then when the feast was over there came ten young men, bringing
flasks and flagons of all kinds, full of the best wine in the
world; and the beggar drank as he had never drank in his life
before, and until his head spun like a top.</p>

<p>So the king and the beggar feasted and made merry, until at last
the clock struck twelve and the king arose from his seat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span> “My
friend,” said he to the beggar, “all these things have been
done to show you that Luck and Fate, which have been against you
for all these years, are now for you. Hereafter, instead of being
poor you shall be the richest of the rich, for I will give you the
greatest thing that I have in my treasury.” Then he called the
chief treasurer, who came forward with a golden tray in his hand.
Upon the tray was a purse of silk. “See,” said the king, “here is
a purse, and in the purse are one hundred pieces of gold money.
But though that much may seem great to you, it is but little of
the true value of the purse. Its virtue lies in this: that however
much you may take from it, there will always be one hundred pieces
of gold money left in it. Now go; and while you are enjoying the
riches which I give you, I have only to ask you to remember these
are not the gifts of Fate, but of a mortal man.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 405px;">
<img src="images/i_b_371.png" width="405" height="500" alt="the king feasted" />
</div>

<p>But all the while he was talking the beggar’s head was spinning and
spinning, and buzzing and buzzing, so that he hardly heard a word
of what the king said.</p>

<p>Then when the king had ended his speech, the lords and gentlemen
who had brought the beggar in led him forth again. Out they went
through room after room&mdash;out through the court-yard, out through
the gate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></p>

<p>Bang&mdash;it was shut to behind him, and he found himself standing in
the darkness of midnight, with the splendid clothes upon his back,
and the magic purse with its hundred pieces of gold money in his
pocket.</p>

<p>He stood looking about himself for a while, and then off he started
homeward, staggering and stumbling and shuffling, for the wine
that he had drank made him so light-headed that all the world spun
topsy-turvy around him.</p>

<p>His way led along by the river, and on he went stumbling and
staggering. All of a sudden&mdash;plump! splash!&mdash;he was in the water
over head and ears. Up he came, spitting out the water and shouting
for help, splashing and sputtering, and kicking and swimming,
knowing no more where he was than the man in the moon. Sometimes
his head was under water and sometimes it was up again.</p>

<p>At last, just as his strength was failing him, his feet struck the
bottom, and he crawled up on the shore more dead than alive. Then,
through fear and cold and wet, he swooned away, and lay for a long
time for all the world as though he were dead.</p>

<p>Now, it chanced that two fishermen were out with their nets that
night, and Luck or Fate led them by the way where the beggar lay on
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span> shore. “Halloa!” said one of the fishermen, “here is a poor
body drowned!” They turned him over, and then they saw what rich
clothes he wore, and felt that he had a purse in his pocket.</p>

<p>“Come,” said the second fisherman, “he is dead, whoever he is. His
fine clothes and his purse of money can do him no good now, and we
might as well have them as anybody else.” So between them both they
stripped the beggar of all that the king had given him, and left
him lying on the beach.</p>

<p>At daybreak the beggar awoke from his swoon, and there he found
himself lying without a stitch to his back, and half dead with the
cold and the water he had swallowed. Then, fearing lest somebody
might see him, he crawled away into the rushes that grew beside the
river, there to hide himself until night should come again.</p>

<p>But as he went, crawling upon hands and knees, he suddenly came
upon a bundle that had been washed up by the water, and when he
laid eyes upon it his heart leaped within him, for what should that
bundle be but the patches and tatters which he had worn the day
before, and which the attendants had thrown over the garden wall
and into the river when they had dressed him in the fine clothes
the king gave him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span></p>

<p>He spread his clothes out in the sun until they were dry, and then
he put them on and went back into the town again.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Well,” said the king, that morning, to his chief councillor, “what
do you think now? Am I not greater than Fate? Did I not make the
beggar rich? and shall I not paint my father’s words out from the
wall, and put my own there instead?”</p>

<p>“I do not know,” said the councillor, shaking his head. “Let us
first see what has become of the beggar.”</p>

<p>“So be it,” said the king; and he and the councillor set off to see
whether the beggar had done as he ought to do with the good things
that the king had given him. So they came to the town-gate, and
there, lo and behold! the first thing that they saw was the beggar
with his wooden bowl in his hand asking those who passed by for a
stray penny or two.</p>

<p>When the king saw him he turned without a word, and rode back home
again. “Very well,” said he to the chief councillor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span> “I have tried
to make the beggar rich and have failed; nevertheless, if I cannot
make him I can ruin him in spite of Fate, and that I will show
you.”</p>

<p>So all that while the beggar sat at the town-gate and begged until
came noontide, when who should he see coming but the same three men
who had come for him the day before. “Ah, ha!” said he to himself,
“now the king is going to give me some more good things.” And so
when the three reached him he was willing enough to go with them,
rough as they were.</p>

<p>Off they marched; but this time they did not come to any garden
with fruits and flowers and fountains and marble baths. Off they
marched, and when they stopped it was in front of the king’s
palace. This time no nobles and great lords and courtiers were
waiting for his coming; but instead of that the town hangman&mdash;a
great ugly fellow, clad in black from head to foot. Up he came to
the beggar, and, catching him by the scruff of the neck, dragged
him up the palace steps and from room to room until at last he
flung him down at the king’s feet.</p>

<p>When the poor beggar gathered wits enough to look about him he
saw there a great chest standing wide open, and with holes in the
lid. He wondered what it was for, but the king gave him no chance
to ask; for, beckoning with his hand, the hangman and the others
caught the beggar by arms and legs, thrust him into the chest, and
banged down the lid upon him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 415px;">
<img src="images/i_b_377.png" width="415" height="200" alt="the beggar crawled out of the chest upon the rocks" />
</div>

<p>The king locked it and double-locked it, and set his seal upon it;
and there was the beggar as tight as a fly in a bottle.</p>

<p>They carried the chest out and thrust it into a cart and hauled it
away, until at last they came to the sea-shore. There they flung
chest and all into the water, and it floated away like a cork. And
that is how the king set about to ruin the poor beggar-man.</p>

<p>Well, the chest floated on and on for three days, and then at last
it came to the shore of a country far away. There the waves caught
it up, and flung it so hard upon the rocks of the sea-beach that
the chest was burst open by the blow, and the beggar crawled out
with eyes as big as saucers and face as white as dough. After he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
had sat for a while, and when his wits came back to him and he had
gathered strength enough, he stood up and looked around to see
where Fate had cast him; and far away on the hill-side he saw the
walls and the roofs and the towers of the great town, shining in
the sunlight as white as snow.</p>

<p>“Well,” said he, “here is something to be thankful for, at least,”
and so saying and shaking the stiffness out of his knees and
elbows, he started off for the white walls and the red roofs in the
distance.</p>

<p>At last he reached the great gate, and through it he could see the
stony streets and multitudes of people coming and going.</p>

<p>But it was not for him to enter that gate. Out popped two soldiers
with great battle-axes in their hands and looking as fierce as
dragons. “Are you a stranger in this town?” said one in a great,
gruff voice.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the beggar, “I am.”</p>

<p>“And where are you going?”</p>

<p>“I am going into the town.”</p>

<p>“No, you are not.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because no stranger enters here. Yonder is the pathway. You must
take that if you would enter the town.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span></p>

<p>“Very well,” said the beggar, “I would just as lief go into the
town that way as another.”</p>

<p>So off he marched without another word. On and on he went along the
narrow pathway until at last he came to a little gate of polished
brass. Over the gate were written these words, in great letters as
red as blood:</p>

<p class="center">“<em>Who Enters here Shall Surely Die.</em>”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 338px;">
<img src="images/i_b_379.png" width="338" height="500" alt="mirror with arched caption: Who Enters Here Shall Surely Die" />
</div>

<p>Many and many a man besides the beggar had travelled that path and
looked up at those letters, and when he had read them had turned
and gone away again. But the beggar neither turned nor went away;
because why, he could neither read nor write a word, and so the
blood-red letters had no fear for him. Up he marched to the brazen
gate, as boldly as though it had been a kitchen door, and rap! tap!
tap! he knocked upon it. He waited awhile, but nobody came. Rap!
tap! tap! he knocked again; and then, after a little while, for the
third time&mdash;Rap! tap! tap! Then instantly the gate swung open and
he entered. So soon as he had crossed the threshold it was banged
to behind him again, just as the garden gate had been when the king
had first sent for him. He found himself in a long, dark entry, and
at the end of it another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span> door, and over it the same words, written
in blood-red letters:</p>

<p class="center">“<em>Beware! Beware! Who Enters here Shall Surely Die!</em>”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the beggar, “this is the hardest town for a body to
come into that I ever saw.” And then he opened the second door and
passed through.</p>

<p>It was fit to deafen a body! Such a shout the beggar’s ears had
never heard before; such a sight the beggar’s eyes had never
beheld, for there, before him, was a great splendid hall of marble
as white as snow. All along the hall stood scores of lords and
ladies in silks and satins, and with jewels on their necks and
arms fit to dazzle a body’s eyes. Right up the middle of the hall
stretched a carpet of blue velvet, and at the farther end, on a
throne of gold, sat a lady as beautiful as the sun and moon and all
the stars.</p>

<p>“Welcome! welcome!” they all shouted, until the beggar was nearly
deafened by the noise they all made, and the lady herself stood up
and smiled upon him.</p>

<p>Then there came three young men, and led the beggar up the carpet
of velvet to the throne of gold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span></p>

<p>“Welcome, my hero!” said the beautiful lady; “and have you, then,
come at last?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the beggar, “I have.”</p>

<p>“Long have I waited for you,” said the lady; “long have I waited
for the hero who would dare without fear to come through the two
gates of death to marry me and to rule as king over this country,
and now at last you are here.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the beggar, “I am.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Meanwhile, while all these things were happening, the king of that
other country had painted out the words his father had written on
the walls, and had had these words painted in in their stead:</p>

<p class="center">“<em>All Things are as Man does.</em>”</p>

<p>For a while he was very well satisfied with them, until, a week
after, he was bidden to the wedding of the Queen of the Golden
Mountains; for when he came there who should the bridegroom be but
the beggar whom he had set adrift in the wooden box a week or so
before.</p>

<p>The bridegroom winked at him, but said never a word, good or ill,
for he was willing to let all that had happened be past and gone.
But the king saw how matters stood as clear as daylight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span> and when
he got back home again he had the new words that stood on the walls
of the room painted out, and had the old ones painted in in bigger
letters than ever:</p>

<p class="center">“<em>All Things <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original text read 'ar'">are</ins> as Fate wills.</em>”</p>

his quart pot, and took a long and hearty pull. Then he banged his

</div>

<p><i>Many and many a man has come to trouble&mdash;so he will say&mdash;by
following his wife’s advice. This is how it was with a man of whom
I shall tell you.</i></p>


<p>There was once upon a time a fisherman who had fished all day long
and had caught not so much as a sprat. So at night there he sat by
the fire, rubbing his knees and warming his shins, and waiting for
supper that his wife was cooking for him, and his hunger was as
sharp as vinegar, and his temper hot enough to fry fat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span></p>

<p>While he sat there grumbling and growling and trying to make
himself comfortable and warm, there suddenly came a knock at the
door. The good woman opened it, and there stood an old man, clad
all in red from head to foot, and with a snowy beard at his chin as
white as winter snow.</p>

<p>The fisherman’s wife stood gaping and staring at the strange
figure, but the old man in red walked straight into the hut.
“Bring your nets, fisherman,” said he, “and come with me. There is
something that I want you to catch for me, and if I have luck I
will pay you for your fishing as never fisherman was paid before.”</p>

<p>“Not I,” said the fisherman; “I go out no more this night. I have
been fishing all day long until my back is nearly broken, and have
caught nothing, and now I am not such a fool as to go out and leave
a warm fire and a good supper at your bidding.”</p>

<p>But the fisherman’s wife had listened to what the old man had said
about paying for the job, and she was of a different mind from her
husband. “Come,” said she, “the old man promises to pay you well.
This is not a chance to be lost, I can tell you, and my advice to
you is that you go.”</p>

<p>The fisherman shook his head. No, he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span> not go; he had said
he would not, and he would not. But the wife only smiled and said
again, “My advice to you is that you go.”</p>

<p>The fisherman grumbled and grumbled, and swore that he would not
go. The wife said nothing but one thing. She did not argue; she did
not lose her temper; she only said to everything that he said, “My
advice to you is that you go.”</p>

<p>At last the fisherman’s anger boiled over. “Very well,” said he,
spitting his words at her; “if you will drive me out into the
night, I suppose I will have to go.” And then he spoke the words
that so many men say: “Many a man has come to trouble by following
his wife’s advice.”</p>

<p>Then down he took his fur cap and up he took his nets, and off
he and the old man marched through the moonlight, their shadows
bobbing along like black spiders behind them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Well, on they went, out from the town and across the fields and
through the woods, until at last they came to a dreary, lonesome
desert, where nothing was to be seen but gray rocks and weeds and
thistles.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the fisherman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span> “I have fished, man and boy, for
forty-seven years, but never did I see as unlikely a place to catch
anything as this.”</p>

<p>But the old man said never a word. First of all he drew a great
circle with strange figures, marking it with his finger upon the
ground. Then out from under his red gown he brought a tinder-box
and steel, and a little silver casket covered all over with strange
figures of serpents and dragons and what not. He brought some
sticks of spice-wood from his pouch, and then he struck a light and
made a fire. Out of the box he took a gray powder, which he flung
upon the little blaze.</p>

<p>Puff! flash! A vivid flame went up into the moonlight, and then
a dense smoke as black as ink, which spread out wider and wider,
far and near, till all below was darker than the darkest midnight.
Then the old man began to utter strange spells and words. Presently
there began a rumbling that sounded louder and louder and nearer
and nearer, until it roared and bellowed like thunder. The earth
rocked and swayed, and the poor fisherman shook and trembled with
fear till his teeth clattered in his head.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the roaring and bellowing ceased, and all was as
still as death, though the darkness was as thick and black as ever.</p>

<p>“Now,” said the old magician&mdash;for such he was&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>“now we are about to
take a journey such as no one ever travelled before. Heed well what
I tell you. Speak not a single word, for if you do, misfortune
will be sure to happen.”</p>

</div>

<p>“Ain’t I to say anything?” said the fisherman.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Not even ‘boo’ to a goose?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well, that is pretty hard upon a man who likes to say his say,”
said the fisherman.</p>

<p>“And moreover,” said the old man, “I must blindfold you as well.”</p>

<p>Thereupon he took from his pocket a handkerchief, and made ready to
tie it about the fisherman’s eyes.</p>

<p>“And ain’t I to see anything at all?” said the fisherman.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Not even so much as a single feather?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” said the fisherman, “I wish I’d not come.”</p>

<p>But the old man tied the handkerchief tightly around his eyes, and
then he was as blind as a bat.</p>

<p>“Now,” said the old man, “throw your leg over what you feel and
hold fast.”</p>

<p>The fisherman reached down his hand, and there felt the back of
something rough and hairy. He flung his leg over it, and whisk!
whizz! off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span> he shot through the air like a sky-rocket. Nothing
was left for him to do but grip tightly with hands and feet and to
hold fast. On they went, and on they went, until, after a great
while, whatever it was that was carrying him lit upon the ground,
and there the fisherman found himself standing, for that which had
brought him had gone.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 279px;">
<img src="images/i_b_393.png" width="279" height="500" alt="the magician watches the fisherman pull on his nets" />
</div>

<p>The old man whipped the handkerchief off his eyes, and there the
fisherman found himself on the shores of the sea, where there was
nothing to be seen but water upon one side and rocks and naked sand
upon the other.</p>

<p>“This is the place for you to cast your nets,” said the old
magician; “for if we catch nothing here we catch nothing at all.”</p>

<p>The fisherman unrolled his nets and cast them and dragged them, and
then cast them and dragged them again, but neither time caught so
much as a herring. But the third time that he cast he found that he
had caught something that weighed as heavy as lead. He pulled and
pulled, until by-and-by he dragged the load ashore, and what should
it be but a great chest of wood, blackened by the sea-water, and
covered with shells and green moss.</p>

<p>That was the very thing that the magician had come to fish for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span></p>

<p>From his pouch the old man took a little golden key, which
he fitted into a key-hole in the side of the chest. He threw
back the lid; the fisherman looked within, and there was the
prettiest little palace that man’s eye ever beheld, all made of
mother-of-pearl and silver-frosted as white as snow. The old
magician lifted the little palace out of the box and set it upon
the ground.</p>

<p>Then, lo and behold! a marvellous thing happened; for the palace
instantly began to grow for all the world like a soap-bubble, until
it stood in the moonlight gleaming and glistening like snow, the
windows bright with the lights of a thousand wax tapers, and the
sound of music and voices and laughter coming from within.</p>

<p>Hardly could the fisherman catch his breath from one strange thing
when another happened. The old magician took off his clothes and
his face&mdash;yes, his face&mdash;for all the world as though it had been
a mask, and there stood as handsome and noble a young man as ever
the light looked on. Then, beckoning to the fisherman, dumb with
wonder, he led the way up the great flight of marble steps to the
palace door. As he came the door swung open with a blaze of light,
and there stood hundreds of noblemen, all clad in silks and satins
and velvets, who, when they saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span> the magician, bowed low before
him, as though he had been a king. Leading the way, they brought
the two through halls and chambers and room after room, each more
magnificent than the other, until they came to one that surpassed a
hundredfold any of the others.</p>

<p>At the farther end was a golden throne, and upon it sat a lady more
lovely and beautiful than a dream, her eyes as bright as diamonds,
her cheeks like rose leaves, and her hair like spun gold. She came
half-way down the steps of the throne to welcome the magician,
and when the two met they kissed one another before all those who
were looking on. Then she brought him to the throne and seated him
beside her, and there they talked for a long time very earnestly.</p>

<p>Nobody said a word to the fisherman, who stood staring about him
like an owl. “I wonder,” said he to himself at last, “if they will
give a body a bite to eat by-and-by?” for, to tell the truth, the
good supper that he had come away from at home had left a sharp
hunger gnawing at his insides, and he longed for something good and
warm to fill the empty place. But time passed, and not so much as a
crust of bread was brought to stay his stomach.</p>

<p>By-and-by the clock struck twelve, and then the two who sat upon
the throne arose. The beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span> lady took the magician by the
hand, and, turning to those who stood around, said, in a loud
voice, “Behold him who alone is worthy to possess the jewel of
jewels! Unto him do I give it, and with it all power of powers!”
Thereon she opened a golden casket that stood beside her, and
brought thence a little crystal ball, about as big as a pigeon’s
egg, in which was something that glistened like a spark of fire.
The magician took the crystal ball and thrust it into his bosom;
but what it was the fisherman could not guess, and if you do not
know I shall not tell you.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 369px;">
<img src="images/i_b_397.png" width="369" height="500" alt="the two met and kissed one another" />
</div>

<p>Then for the first time the beautiful lady seemed to notice the
fisherman. She beckoned him, and when he stood beside her two
men came carrying a chest. The chief treasurer opened it, and it
was full of bags of gold money. “How will you have it?” said the
beautiful lady.</p>

<p>“Have what?” said the fisherman.</p>

<p>“Have the pay for your labor?” said the beautiful lady.</p>

<p>“I will,” said the fisherman, promptly, “take it in my hat.”</p>

<p>“So be it,” said the beautiful lady. She waved her hand, and the
chief treasurer took a bag from the chest, untied it, and emptied a
cataract of gold into the fur cap. The fisherman had never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span> seen
so much wealth in all his life before, and he stood like a man
turned to stone.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 426px;">
<img src="images/i_b_399.png" width="426" height="500" alt="the fisherman had his net over one arm" />
</div>

<p>“Is all this mine?” said the fisherman.</p>

<p>“It is,” said the beautiful lady.</p>

<p>“Then God bless your pretty eyes,” said the fisherman.</p>

<p>Then the magician kissed the beautiful lady, and, beckoning to the
fisherman, left the throne-room the same way that they had come.
The noblemen, in silks and satins and velvets, marched ahead, and
back they went through the other apartments, until at last they
came to the door.</p>

<p>Out they stepped, and then what do you suppose happened?</p>

<p>If the wonderful palace had grown like a bubble, like a bubble it
vanished. There the two stood on the sea-shore, with nothing to be
seen but rocks and sand and water, and the starry sky overhead.</p>

<p>The fisherman shook his cap of gold, and it jingled and tinkled,
and was as heavy as lead. If it was not all a dream, he was rich
for life. “But anyhow,” said he, “they might have given a body a
bite to eat.”</p>

<p>The magician put on his red clothes and his face again, making
himself as hoary and as old as before. He took out his flint and
steel, and his sticks of spice-wood and his gray powder, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span> made
a great fire and smoke just as he had done before. Then again he
tied his handkerchief over the fisherman’s eyes. “Remember,” said
he, “what I told you when we started upon our journey. Keep your
mouth tight shut, for if you utter so much as a single word you are
a lost man. Now throw your leg over what you feel and hold fast.”</p>

<p>The fisherman had his net over one arm and his cap of gold in the
other hand; nevertheless, there he felt the same hairy thing he had
felt before. He flung his leg over it, and away he was gone through
the air like a sky-rocket.</p>

<p>Now, he had grown somewhat used to strange things by this time, so
he began to think that he would like to see what sort of a creature
it was upon which he was riding thus through the sky. So he
contrived, in spite of his net and cap, to push up the handkerchief
from over one eye. Out he peeped, and then he saw as clear as day
what the strange steed was.</p>

<p>He was riding upon a he-goat as black as night, and in front of him
was the magician riding upon just such another, his great red robe
fluttering out behind him in the moonlight like huge red wings.</p>

<p>“Great herring and little fishes!” roared the fisherman;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span> “it is a
billy-goat!”</p>

<p>Instantly goats, old man, and all were gone like a flash. Down fell
the fisherman through the empty sky, whirling over and over and
around and around like a frog. He held tightly to his net, but away
flew his fur cap, the golden money falling in a shower like sparks
of yellow light. Down he fell and down he fell, until his head spun
like a top.</p>

<p>By good-luck his house was just below, with its thatch of soft
rushes. Into the very middle of it he tumbled, and right through
the thatch&mdash;bump!&mdash;into the room below.</p>

<p>The good wife was in bed, snoring away for dear life; but such
a noise as the fisherman made coming into the house was enough
to wake the dead. Up she jumped, and there she sat, staring and
winking with sleep, and with her brains as addled as a duck’s egg
in a thunder-storm.</p>

<p>“There!” said the fisherman, as he gathered himself up and rubbed
his shoulder, “that is what comes of following a woman’s advice!”</p>

<h2><a name="The_Salt_of_Life" id="The_Salt_of_Life"></a>The Salt of Life.</h2>

</div>

<p>Once upon a time there was a king who had three sons, and by the
time that the youngest prince had down upon his chin the king
had grown so old that the cares of the kingdom began to rest
over-heavily upon his shoulders. So he called his chief councillor
and told him that he was of a mind to let the princes reign in his
stead. To the son who loved him the best he would give the largest
part of his kingdom, to the son who loved him the next best the
next part, and to the son who loved him the least the least part.
The old councillor was very wise and shook his head, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
king’s mind had long been settled as to what he was about to do. So
he called the princes to him one by one and asked each as to how
much he loved him.</p>

<p>“I love you as a mountain of gold,” said the oldest prince, and the
king was very pleased that his son should give him such love.</p>

<p>“I love you as a mountain of silver,” said the second prince, and
the king was pleased with that also.</p>

<p>But when the youngest prince was called, he did not answer at
first, but thought and thought. At last he looked up. “I love you,”
said he, “as I love salt.”</p>

<p>When the king heard what his youngest son said he was filled with
anger. “What!” he cried, “do you love me no better than salt&mdash;a
stuff that is the most bitter of all things to the taste, and the
cheapest and the commonest of all things in the world? Away with
you, and never let me see your face again! Henceforth you are no
son of mine.”</p>

<p>The prince would have spoken, but the king would not allow him, and
bade his guards thrust the young man forth from the room.</p>

<p>Now the queen loved the youngest prince the best of all her sons,
and when she heard how the king was about to drive him forth into
the wide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span> world to shift for himself, she wept and wept. “Ah, my
son!” said she to him, “it is little or nothing that I have to give
you. Nevertheless, I have one precious thing. Here is a ring; take
it and wear it always, for so long as you have it upon your finger
no magic can have power over you.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 467px;">
<img src="images/i_b_407.png" width="467" height="500" alt="the king bade his guards thrust the young man from the room" />
</div>

<p>Thus it was that the youngest prince set forth into the wide world
with little or nothing but a ring upon his finger.</p>

<p>For seven days he travelled on, and knew not where he was going or
whither his footsteps led. At the end of that time he came to the
gates of a town. The prince entered the gates, and found himself in
a city the like of which he had never seen in his life before for
grandeur and magnificence&mdash;beautiful palaces and gardens, stores
and bazaars crowded with rich stuffs of satin and silk and wrought
silver and gold of cunningest workmanship; for the land to which
he had come was the richest in all of the world. All that day he
wandered up and down, and thought nothing of weariness and hunger
for wonder of all that he saw. But at last evening drew down, and
he began to bethink himself of somewhere to lodge during the night.</p>

<p>Just then he came to a bridge, over the wall of which leaned an
old man with a long white beard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span> looking down into the water.
He was dressed richly but soberly, and every now and then he
sighed and groaned, and as the prince drew near he saw the tears
falling&mdash;drip, drip&mdash;from the old man’s eyes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 372px;">
<img src="images/i_b_409.png" width="372" height="500" alt="old man leaning over the wall of the bridge" />
</div>

<p>The prince had a kind heart, and could not bear to see one in
distress; so he spoke to the old man, and asked him his trouble.</p>

<p>“Ah, me!” said the other, “only yesterday I had a son, tall and
handsome like yourself. But the queen took him to sup with her, and
I am left all alone in my old age, like a tree stripped of leaves
and fruit.”</p>

<p>“But surely,” said the prince, “it can be no such sad matter to sup
with a queen. That is an honor that most men covet.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the old man, “you are a stranger in this place, or else
you would know that no youth so chosen to sup with the queen ever
returns to his home again.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the prince, “I am a stranger and have only come hither
this day, and so do not understand these things. Even when I found
you I was about to ask the way to some inn where folk of good
condition lodge.”</p>

<p>“Then come home with me to-night,” said the old man. “I live
all alone, and I will tell you the trouble that lies upon this
country.” Thereupon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span> taking the prince by the arm, he led him
across the bridge and to another quarter of the town where he
dwelt. He bade the servants prepare a fine supper, and he and the
prince sat down to the table together. After they had made an end
of eating and drinking, the old man told the prince all concerning
those things of which he had spoken, and thus it was:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“When the king of this land died he left behind him three
daughters&mdash;the most beautiful princesses in all of the world.</p>

<p>“Folk hardly dared speak of the eldest of them, but whisperings
said that she was a sorceress, and that strange and gruesome things
were done by her. The second princess was also a witch, though it
was not said that she was evil, like the other. As for the youngest
of the three, she was as beautiful as the morning and as gentle as
a dove. When she was born a golden thread was about her neck, and
it was foretold of her that she was to be the queen of that land.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span></p>
<p>“But not long after the old king died the youngest princess
vanished&mdash;no one could tell whither, and no one dared to ask&mdash;and
the eldest princess had herself crowned as queen, and no one
dared gainsay her. For a while everything went well enough, but
by-and-by evil days came upon the land. Once every seven days the
queen would bid some youth, young and strong, to sup with her,
and from that time no one ever heard of him again, and no one
dared ask what had become of him. At first it was the great folk
at the queen’s palace&mdash;officers and courtiers&mdash;who suffered; but
by-and-by the sons of the merchants and the chief men of the city
began to be taken. One time,” said the old man, “I myself had three
sons&mdash;as noble young men as could be found in the wide world. One
day the chief of the queen’s officers came to my house and asked me
concerning how many sons I had. I was forced to tell him, and in a
little while they were taken one by one to the queen’s palace, and
I never saw them again.</p>

<p>“But misfortune, like death, comes upon the young as well as the
old. You yourself have had trouble, or else I am mistaken. Tell me
what lies upon your heart, my son, for the talking of it makes the
burthen lighter.”</p>

<p>The prince did as the old man bade him, and told all of his story;
and so they sat talking and talking until far into the night, and
the old man grew fonder and fonder of the prince the more he saw of
him. So the end of the matter was that he asked the prince to live
with him as his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span> son, seeing that the young man had now no father
and he no children, and the prince consented gladly enough.</p>

<p>So the two lived together like father and son, and the good old man
began to take some joy in life once more.</p>

<p>But one day who should come riding up to the door but the chief of
the queen’s officers.</p>

<p>“How is this?” said he to the old man, when he saw the prince. “Did
you not tell me that you had but three sons, and is this not a
fourth?”</p>

<p>It was of no use for the old man to tell the officer that the
youth was not his son, but was a prince who had come to visit that
country. The officer drew forth his tablets and wrote something
upon them, and then went his way, leaving the old man sighing and
groaning. “Ah, me!” said he, “my heart sadly forebodes trouble.”</p>

<p>Sure enough, before three days had passed a bidding came to the
prince to make ready to sup with the queen that night.</p>

<p>When evening drew near a troop of horsemen came, bringing a white
horse with a saddle and bridle of gold studded with precious
stones, to take the prince to the queen’s palace.</p>

<p>As soon as they had brought him thither they led the prince to
a room where was a golden table spread with a snow-white cloth
and set with dishes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span> of gold. At the end of the table the queen
sat waiting for him, and her face was hidden by a veil of silver
gauze. She raised the veil and looked at the prince, and when he
saw her face he stood as one wonder-struck, for not only was she so
beautiful, but she set a spell upon him with the evil charm of her
eyes. No one sat at the table but the queen and the prince, and a
score of young pages served them, and sweet music sounded from a
curtained gallery.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 373px;">
<img src="images/i_b_414.png" width="373" height="300" alt="the queen sat waiting for him, her face hidden by a veil" />
</div>

<p>At last came midnight, and suddenly a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span> gong sounded from the
court-yard outside. Then in an instant the music was stopped, the
pages that served them hurried from the room, and presently all was
as still as death.</p>

<p>Then, when all were gone, the queen arose and beckoned the prince,
and he had no choice but to arise also and follow whither she led.
She took him through the palace, where all was as still as the
grave, and so came out by a postern door into a garden. Beside the
postern a torch burned in a bracket. The queen took it down, and
then led the prince up a path and under the silent trees until they
came to a great wall of rough stone. She pressed her hand upon one
of the great stones, and it opened like a door, and there was a
flight of steps that led downward. The queen descended these steps,
and the prince followed closely behind her. At the bottom was a
long passage-way, and at the farther end the prince saw what looked
like a bright spark of light, as though the sun were shining. She
thrust the torch into another bracket in the wall of the passage,
and then led the way towards the light. It grew larger and larger
as they went forward, until at last they came out at the farther
end, and there the prince found himself standing in the sunlight
and not far from the sea-shore. The queen led the way towards the
shore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span> when suddenly a great number of black dogs came running
towards them, barking and snarling, and showing their teeth as
though they would tear the two in pieces. But the queen drew from
her bosom a whip with a steel-pointed lash, and as the dogs came
springing towards them she laid about her right and left, till the
skin flew and the blood ran, and the dogs leaped away howling and
yelping.</p>

<p>At the edge of the water was a great stone mill, and the queen
pointed towards it and bade the prince turn it. Strong as he
was, it was as much as he could do to work it; but grind it he
did, though the sweat ran down his face in streams. By-and-by a
speck appeared far away upon the water; and as the prince ground
and ground at the mill the speck grew larger and larger. It was
something upon the water, and it came nearer and nearer as swiftly
as the wind. At last it came close enough for him to see that it
was a little boat all of brass. By-and-by the boat struck upon the
beach, and as soon as it did so the queen entered it, bidding the
prince do the same.</p>

<p>No sooner were they seated than away the boat went, still as
swiftly as the wind. On it flew and on it flew, until at last
they came to another shore, the like of which the prince had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>never seen in his life before. Down to the edge of the water ran
a garden&mdash;but such a garden! The leaves of the trees were all of
silver and the fruit of gold, and instead of flowers were precious
stones&mdash;white, red, yellow, blue, and green&mdash;that flashed like
sparks of sunlight as the breeze moved them this way and that way.
Beyond the silver trees, with their golden fruit, was a great
palace as white as snow, and so bright that one had to shut one’s
eyes as one looked upon it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 398px;">
<img src="images/i_b_417.png" width="398" height="500" alt="they were seated in the boart which went as swiftly as the wind" />
</div>

<p>The boat ran up on the beach close to just such a stone mill as the
prince had seen upon the other side of the water, and then he and
the queen stepped ashore. As soon as they had done so the brazen
boat floated swiftly away, and in a little while was gone.</p>

<p>“Here our journey ends,” said the queen. “Is it not a wonderful
land, and well worth the seeing? Look at all these jewels and this
gold, as plenty as fruits and flowers at home. You may take what
you please; but while you are gathering them I have another matter
after which I must look. Wait for me here, and by-and-by I will be
back again.”</p>

<p>So saying, she turned and left the prince, going towards the castle
back of the trees.</p>

<p>But the prince was a prince, and not a common man; he cared nothing
for gold and jewels.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span> What he did care for was to see where the
queen went, and why she had brought him to this strange land. So,
as soon as she had fairly gone, he followed after.</p>

<p>He went along under the gold and silver trees, in the direction she
had taken, until at last he came to a tall flight of steps that led
up to the doorway of the snow-white palace. The door stood open,
and into it the prince went. He saw not a soul, but he heard a
noise as of blows and the sound as of some one weeping. He followed
the sound, until by-and-by he came to a great vaulted room in the
very centre of the palace. A curtain hung at the doorway. The
prince lifted it and peeped within, and this was what he saw:</p>

<p>In the middle of the room was a marble basin of water as clear
as crystal, and around the sides of the basin were these words,
written in letters of gold:</p>


<p class="center">“<em>Whatsoever is False, that I make True</em>.”</p>

<p>Beside the fountain upon a marble stand stood a statue of a
beautiful woman made of alabaster, and around the neck of the
statue was a thread of gold. The queen stood beside the statue, and
beat and beat it with her steel-tipped whip. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span> all the while she
lashed it the statue sighed and groaned like a living being, and
the tears ran down its stone cheeks as though it were a suffering
Christian. By-and-by the queen rested for a moment, and said,
panting, “Will you give me the thread of gold?” and the statue
answered “No.” Whereupon she fell to raining blows upon it as she
had done before.</p>

<p>So she continued, now beating the statue and now asking it whether
it would give her the thread of gold, to which the statue always
answered “No,” and all the while the prince stood gazing and
wondering. By-and-by the queen wearied of what she was doing, and
thrust the steel-tipped lash back into her bosom again, upon which
the prince, seeing that she was done, hurried back to the garden
where she had left him and pretended to be gathering the golden
fruit and jewel flowers.</p>

<p>The queen said nothing to him good or bad, except to command him
to grind at the great stone mill as he had done on the other side
of the water. Thereupon the prince did as she bade, and presently
the brazen boat came skimming over the water more swiftly than
the wind. Again the queen and the prince entered it, and again it
carried them to the other side whence they had come.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 305px;">
<img src="images/i_b_421.png" width="305" height="500" alt="the queen beat the statue with her steel-tipped whip" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span></p>

<p>No sooner had the queen set foot upon the shore than she stooped
and gathered up a handful of sand. Then, turning as quick as
lightning, she flung it into the prince’s face. “Be a black dog,”
she cried in a loud voice, “and join your comrades!”</p>

<p>And now it was that the ring that the prince’s mother had given him
stood him in good stead. But for it he would have become a black
dog like those others, for thus it had happened to all before him
who had ferried the witch queen over the water. So she expected to
see him run away yelping, as those others had done; but the prince
remained a prince, and stood looking her in the face.</p>

<p>When the queen saw that her magic had failed her she grew as pale
as death, and fell to trembling in every limb. She turned and
hastened quickly away, and the prince followed her wondering, for
he neither knew the mischief she had intended doing him, nor how
his ring had saved him from the fate of those others.</p>

<p>So they came back up the stairs and out through the stone wall into
the palace garden. The queen pressed her hand against the stone and
it turned back into its place again. Then, beckoning to the prince,
she hurried away down the garden. Before he followed he picked up
a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span> coal that lay near by, and put a cross upon the stone; then he
hurried after her, and so came to the palace once more.</p>

<p>By this time the cocks were crowing, and the dawn of day was just
beginning to show over the roof-tops and the chimney-stacks of the
town.</p>

<p>As for the queen, she had regained her composure, and, bidding the
prince wait for her a moment, she hastened to her chamber. There
she opened her book of magic, and in it she soon found who the
prince was and how the ring had saved him.</p>

<p>When she had learned all that she wanted to know she put on a
smiling face and came back to him. “Ah, prince,” said she, “I well
know who you are, for your coming to my country is no secret to me.
I have shown you strange things to-night. I will unfold all the
wonder to you another time. Will you not come back and sup with me
again?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the prince, “I will come whensoever you bid me;” for he
was curious to know the secret of the statue and the strange things
he had seen.</p>

<p>“And will you not give me a pledge of your coming?” said the queen,
still smiling.</p>

<p>“What pledge shall I give you,” said the prince.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span></p>

<p>“Give me the ring that is upon your finger,” said the queen; and
she smiled so bewitchingly that the prince could not have refused
her had he desired to do so.</p>

<p>Alas for him! He thought no evil, but, without a word, drew off the
ring and gave it to the queen, and she slipped it upon her finger.</p>

<p>“O fool!” she cried, laughing a wicked laugh, “O fool! to give away
that in which your safety lay!” As she spoke she dipped her fingers
into a basin of water that stood near by and dashed the drops into
the prince’s face. “Be a raven,” she cried, “and a raven remain!”</p>

<p>In an instant the prince was a prince no longer, but a coal-black
raven. The queen snatched up a sword that lay near by and struck
at him to kill him. But the raven-prince leaped aside and the blow
missed its aim.</p>

<p>By good luck a window stood open, and before the queen could strike
again he spread his wings and flew out of the open casement and
over the house-tops, and was gone.</p>

<p>On he flew and on he flew until he came to the old man’s house, and
so to the room where his foster-father himself was sitting. He lit
upon the ground at the old man’s feet and tried to tell him what
had befallen, but all that he could say was “Croak! croak!”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 461px;">
<img src="images/i_b_425.png" width="461" height="500" alt="the raven spread his wings and flew out the window" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span></p>

<p>“What brings this bird of ill omen?” said the old man, and he
drew his sword to kill it. He raised his hand to strike, but the
raven did not try to fly away as he had expected, but bowed his
neck to receive the stroke. Then the old man saw that the tears
were running down from the raven’s eyes, and he held his hand.
“What strange thing is this?” he said. “Surely nothing but the
living soul weeps; and how, then, can this bird shed tears?” So
he took the raven up and looked into his eyes, and in them he saw
the prince’s soul. “Alas!” he cried, “my heart misgives me that
something strange has happened. Tell me, is this not my foster-son,
the prince?”</p>

<p>The raven answered “Croak!” and nothing else; but the good old man
understood it all, and the tears ran down his cheeks and trickled
over his beard. “Whether man or raven, you shall still be my son,”
said he, and he held the raven close in his arms and caressed it.</p>

<p>He had a golden cage made for the bird, and every day he would walk
with it in the garden, talking to it as a father talks to his son.</p>

<p>One day when they were thus in the garden together a strange
lady came towards them down the pathway. Over her head and face
was drawn a thick veil, so that the two could not tell who she
was. When she came close to them she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span> raised the veil, and the
raven-prince saw that her face was the living likeness of the
queen’s; and yet there was something in it that was different. It
was the second sister of the queen, and the old man knew her and
bowed before her.</p>

<p>“Listen,” said she. “I know what the raven is, and that it is the
prince, whom the queen has bewitched. I also know nearly as much of
magic as she, and it is that alone that has saved me so long from
ill. But danger hangs close over me; the queen only waits for the
chance to bewitch me; and some day she will overpower me, for she
is stronger than I. With the prince’s aid I can overcome her and
make myself forever safe, and it is this that has brought me here
to-day. My magic is powerful enough to change the prince back into
his true shape again, and I will do so if he will aid me in what
follows, and this is it: I will conjure the queen, and by-and-by
a great eagle will come flying, and its plumage will be as black
as night. Then I myself will become an eagle, with black-and-white
plumage, and we two will fight in the air. After a while we will
both fall to the ground, and then the prince must cut off the head
of the black eagle with a knife I shall give him. Will you do
this,” said she, turning to the raven,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span> “if I transform you to your
true shape?”</p>

<p>The raven bowed his head and said “Croak!” And the sister of the
queen knew that he meant yes.</p>

<p>Therewith she drew a great, long, keen knife from her bosom, and
thrust it into the ground. “It is with this knife of magic,” said
she, “that you must cut off the black eagle’s head.” Then the
witch-princess gathered up some sand in her hand, and flung it into
the raven’s face. “Resume,” cried she, “your own shape!” And in an
instant the prince was himself again. The next thing the sister
of the queen did was to draw a circle upon the ground around the
prince, the old man, and herself. On the circle she marked strange
figures here and there. Then, all three standing close together,
she began her conjurations, uttering strange words&mdash;now under her
breath, and now clear and loud.</p>

<p>Presently the sky darkened, and it began to thunder and rumble.
Darker it grew and darker, and the thunder crashed and roared. The
earth trembled under their feet, and the trees swayed hither and
thither as though tossed by a tempest. Then suddenly the uproar
ceased and all grew as still as death, the clouds rolled away,
and in a moment the sun shone out once more, and all was calm and
serene as it had been before. But still the princess muttered her
conjurations, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span> as the prince and the old man looked they
beheld a speck that grew larger and larger, until they saw that
it was an eagle as black as night that was coming swiftly flying
through the sky. Then the queen’s sister also saw it and ceased
from her spells. She drew a little cap of feathers from her bosom
with trembling hands. “Remember,” said she to the prince; and, so
saying, clapped the feather cap upon her head. In an instant she
herself became an eagle&mdash;pied, black and white&mdash;and, spreading her
wings, leaped into the air.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 396px;">
<img src="images/i_b_429.png" width="396" height="500" alt="the two eagles dashed against one another" />
</div>

<p>For a while the two eagles circled around and around; but at last
they dashed against one another, and, grappling with their talons,
tumbled over and over until they struck the ground close to the two
who stood looking.</p>

<p>Then the prince snatched the knife from the ground and ran to where
they lay struggling. “Which was I to kill?” said he to the old man.</p>

<p>“Are they not birds of a feather?” cried the foster-father. “Kill
them both, for then only shall we all be safe.”</p>

<p>The prince needed no second telling to see the wisdom of what the
old man said. In an instant he struck off the heads of both the
eagles, and thus put an end to both sorceresses, the lesser as
well as the greater. They buried both of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span> eagles in the garden
without telling any one of what had happened. So soon as that was
done the old man bade the prince tell him all that had befallen
him, and the prince did so.</p>

<p>“Aye! aye!” said the old man, “I see it all as clear as day. The
black dogs are the young men who have supped with the queen; the
statue is the good princess; and the basin of water is the water of
life, which has the power of taking away magic. Come; let us make
haste to bring help to all those poor unfortunates who have been
lying under the queen’s spells.”</p>

<p>The prince needed no urging to do that. They hurried to the palace;
they crossed the garden to the stone wall. There they found the
stone upon which the prince had set the black cross. He pressed his
hand upon it, and it opened to him like a door. They descended the
steps, and went through the passageway, until they came out upon
the sea-shore. The black dogs came leaping towards them; but this
time it was to fawn upon them, and to lick their hands and faces.</p>

<p>The prince turned the great stone mill till the brazen boat came
flying towards the shore. They entered it, and so crossed the water
and came to the other side. They did not tarry in the garden, but
went straight to the snow-white palace and to the great vaulted
chamber where was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span> statue. “Yes,” said the old man, “it is the
youngest princess, sure enough.”</p>

<p>The prince said nothing, but he dipped up some of the water in his
palm and dashed it upon the statue. “If you are the princess, take
your true shape again,” said he. Before the words had left his lips
the statue became flesh and blood, and the princess stepped down
from where she stood, and the prince thought that he had never seen
any one so beautiful as she. “You have brought me back to life,”
said she, “and whatever I shall have shall be yours as well as
mine.”</p>

<p>Then they all set their faces homeward again, and the prince took
with him a cupful of the water of life.</p>

<p>When they reached the farther shore the black dogs came running to
meet them. The prince sprinkled the water he carried upon them, and
as soon as it touched them that instant they were black dogs no
longer, but the tall, noble young men that the sorceress queen had
bewitched. There, as the old man had hoped, he found his own three
sons, and kissed them with the tears running down his face.</p>

<p>But when the people of that land learned that their youngest
princess, and the one whom they loved, had come back again, and
that the two sorceresses would trouble them no longer, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>shouted and shouted for joy. All the town was hung with flags and
illuminated, the fountains ran with wine, and nothing was heard but
sounds of rejoicing. In the midst of it all the prince married the
princess, and so became the king of that country.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 264px;">
<img src="images/i_b_433.png" width="264" height="500" alt="the prince brings the princess back to life" />
</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And now to go back again to the beginning.</p>

<p>After the youngest prince had been driven away from home, and the
old king had divided the kingdom betwixt the other two, things
went for a while smoothly and joyfully. But by little and little
the king was put to one side until he became as nothing in his own
land. At last hot words passed between the father and the two sons,
and the end of the matter was that the king was driven from the
land to shift for himself.</p>

<p>Now, after the youngest prince had married and had become king of
that other land, he bethought himself of his father and his mother,
and longed to see them again. So he set forth and travelled towards
his old home. In his journeying he came to a lonely house at the
edge of a great forest, and there night came upon him. He sent one
of the many of those who rode with him to ask whether he could not
find lodging there for the time, and who should answer the summons
but the king, his father, dressed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span> coarse clothing of a
forester. The old king did not know his own son in the kingly young
king who sat upon his snow-white horse. He bade the visitor to
enter, and he and the old queen served their son and bowed before
him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_b_435.png" width="500" height="370" alt="the king chastises his parents" />
</div>

<p>The next morning the young king rode back to his own land, and then
sent attendants with horses and splendid clothes, and bade them
bring his father and mother to his own home.</p>

<p>He had a noble feast set for them, with everything befitting the
entertainment of a king, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span> he ordered that not a grain of salt
should season it.</p>

<p>So the father and the mother sat down to the feast with their son
and his queen, but all the time they did not know him. The old king
tasted the food and tasted the food, but he could not eat of it.</p>

<p>“Do you not feel hungry?” said the young king.</p>

<p>“Alas,” said his father, “I crave your majesty’s pardon, but there
is no salt in the food.”</p>

<p>“And so is life lacking of savor without love,” said the young
king; “and yet because I loved you as salt you disowned me and cast
me out into the world.”</p>

<p>Therewith he could contain himself no longer, but with the tears
running down his cheeks kissed his father and his mother; and they
knew him, and kissed him again.</p>

<p>Afterwards the young king went with a great army into the country
of his elder brothers, and, overcoming them, set his father upon
his throne again. If ever the two got back their crowns you may
be sure that they wore them more modestly than they did the first
time.</p>
